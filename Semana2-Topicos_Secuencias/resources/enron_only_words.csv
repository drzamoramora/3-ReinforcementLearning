here is our forecast
traveling to have a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip especially if you have to prepare a presentation i would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings i would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary as far as the business meetings i think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn the meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format my suggestion for where to go is austin play golf and rent a ski boat and jet skis flying somewhere takes too much time
test successful way to go

traveling to have a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip especially if you have to prepare a presentation i would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings i would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary as far as the business meetings i think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn the meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format my suggestion for where to go is austin play golf and rent a ski boat and jet skis flying somewhere takes too much time

traveling to have a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip especially if you have to prepare a presentation i would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings i would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary as far as the business meetings i think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn the meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format my suggestion for where to go is austin play golf and rent a ski boat and jet skis flying somewhere takes too much time

frank the implied risk created by the san juan and rockies indeces being partially set after today is the same as the risk in a long futures position whatever the risk was prior should not matter since the rest of the books are very short price this should be a large offset if the var calculation does not match the companys true risk then it needs to be revised or adjusted phillip

adrianne last night i spoke to two potential candidates for the trading track emil carlsson and thomas considine emil is currently tutoring at hofstra after leaving an option trading position i would recommend bringing emil to houston for further interviews based on his technical knowledge the biggest drawback was his current situation might show a lack of motivation thomas was working as an equity market maker he is interested in making a change to a job where he can develop more expertise he is seeking to develop a better understanding of the market he trades the trading track would be an excellent match for his desires i would also recommend bringing thomas to houston for further consideration phillip

scott i emailed your question to a friend that works for the new company i think i know the answer to your questions but i want to get the exact details from him basically they will offer energy online at a fixed price or some price that undercuts the current provider then once their sales are large enough they will go to the wholesale market to hedge and lock in a profit the risk is that they have built in enough margin to give them room to manage the price risk this is my best guess i will get back to you with more phillip

traveling to have a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip especially if you have to prepare a presentation i would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings i would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary as far as the business meetings i think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn the meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format my suggestion for where to go is austin play golf and rent a ski boat and jet skis flying somewhere takes too much time

frank the implied risk created by the san juan and rockies indeces being partially set after today is the same as the risk in a long futures position whatever the risk was prior should not matter since the rest of the books are very short price this should be a large offset if the var calculation does not match the companys true risk then it needs to be revised or adjusted phillip

dutch the increase in position and subsequent position limit violation was due to two factors first a long position was moved into the long term exotics book due to the nature of the position i am currently using the ltx to hold longer term strategic positions the large increase in position is a reflection of my view of the market second a large customer transaction originated by fred lagrastas group was transacted at the end of the day monday and was not able to be hedged until this morning hence a large position increase occurred for yesterdays position and a corresponding decrease occurred today john

dutch the increase in position and subsequent position limit violation was due to two factors first a long position was moved into the long term exotics book due to the nature of the position i am currently using the ltx to hold longer term strategic positions the large increase in position is a reflection of my view of the market second a large customer transaction originated by fred lagrastas group was transacted at the end of the day monday and was not able to be hedged until this morning hence a large position increase occurred for yesterdays position and a corresponding decrease occurred today john

now you know the rest of the story new date rape drug beware date rape drug targets males urp police warn all male clubbers party goers and unsuspecting pub regulars to be alert and stay cautious when offered a drink from any woman a new date rape drug on the market called beer is used by females to target unsuspecting men the drug is generally found in liquid form and is now available almost anywhere beer is used by female sexual predators at parties and bars to persuade their male victims to go home and have sex with them typically a woman needs only to persuade a guy to consume a few units of beer and then simply ask him home for no strings attached sex men are rendered helpless against this approach after several beers men will often succumb to desires to perform sexual acts on horrific looking women to whom they would never normally be attracted after drinking beer men often awaken with only hazy memories of exactly what happened to them the night before often with just a vague feeling that something bad occurred at other times these unfortunate men are swindled out of their lifes savings in a familiar scam known as a relationship apparently men are much more susceptible to this scam after beer is administered and sex is offered by the predatory female please forward this warning to every male you know however if you fall victim to this insidious beer and the predatory women administering it there are male support groups with venues in every town where you can discuss the details of your shocking encounter in an open and frank manner with similarly affected like minded guys for the support group nearest you just look up golf courses in the yellow pages

sometimes we wonder why friends keep forwarding jokes to us without writing a word maybe this could explain when you are very busy but still want to keep in touch guess what you do you forward jokes when you have nothing to say but still want to keep contact you forward jokes when you have something to say but dont know what and dont know how you forward jokes and to let you know that you are still remembered you are still important you are still loved you are still cared for guess what you get a forwarded joke so my friend next time if you get a joke dont think that youve been sent just another forwarded joke but that youve been thought of today and your friend on the other end of your computer wanted to send you a smile

aint it so true original message story with a moral a boy rode on a donkey and the old man walked as they went along they passed some people who remarked it was a shame the old man was walking and the boy was riding the man and boy thought maybe the critics were right so they changed positions later they passed some people that remarked what a shame he makes that little boy walkthey then decided they both would walk soon they passed some more people who thought they were stupid to walk when they had a decent donkey to ride sothey both rode the donkey now they passed some people that shamed them by saying how awful to put such a load on a poor donkey the boy and man said they were probably right so they decided to carry the donkey as they crossed the bridge they lost their grip on the animal and he fell into the river and drowned the moral of the story if you try to please everyone you might as well kiss your ass good bye

now we know the difference on the differences between capitalism communism and enronism capitalism you have two cows you sell one and buy a bull your herd multiplies and the economy grows you sell them and retire on the income communism you have two cows your neighbors help take care of them and you all share the milk enronism you have two cows you sell three of them to your publicly listed company using letters of credit opened by your brother in law at the bank then execute a debtequity swap with an associated general offer so you get all four cows back with a tax exemption for five cows the milk rights of the six cows are transferred via an intermediary to a cayman island company secretly owned by the majority shareholder who sells the rights to all seven cows back to your listed company you hire arthur andersen to revise your books the annual report says the company owns eight cows with an option on one more

suggestion make a playbook that just shows individual routes that way luis can just customize in the huddle ex outs curls out and up post etc also you give routes to the linemen and they should block and then roll out into the open flats once the defense goes past and most importantly how did you draw those plays excel

as you are aware enron signed an agreement with blockbuster inc last summer to launch an entertainment on demand service we announced today that we are discontinuing our exclusive relationship with blockbuster in order to expand the offering by developing direct relationships with content providers and distribution partners we have made tremendous progress toward our goal of becoming the leading provider of entertainment on demand over a digital platform we rolled out the trial service in seattle portland salt lake city and new york in december and today subscribers are buying movies on demand using the service we created however the exclusive relationship with blockbuster has not yielded the quantity and quality of movies needed to drive demand for this exciting new on demand service now that we have proven the concept we want to take our service to the next level by adding content and subscribers on an accelerated basis we feel that this can be best achieved by pursuing entertainment on demand independently we intend to initiate discussions with various content providers for delivering their content over the enron platform we remain very positive about the potential of this business for ebs and enron and will keep you apprised of our progress

oldy but goody a christmas tale one particular christmas a long time ago santa was getting ready for his annual trip but there were problems everywhere four of his elves got sick and the trainee elves did not produce the toys as fast as the regular ones so santa was beginning to feel the pressure of being behind schedule then mrs claus told him that her mom was coming to visit this stressed santa even more then when he went to harness the reindeer he found three of them were about to give birth and two had jumped the fence and were out heaven knows where more stress then when he began to load the sleigh one of the boards cracked and the toy bag fell to the ground and scattered the toys so frustrated santa went back into the house for a cup of coffee and a shot of whiskey when he went to the cupboard he discovered that the elves had hidden the liquor and there was nothing to drink in his frustration he accidentally dropped the coffee pot and it broke into hundreds of little pieces all over the kitchen floor he went to get the broom and found that mice had eaten the straw it was made from just then the doorbell rang and santa cussed his way to the door he opened the door and there was a little angel with a great big christmas tree the angel said very cheerfully merry christmas santa isnt it just a lovely day i have a beautiful tree for you isnt it just a lovely tree where would you like me to stick it thus began the tradition of the little angel on top of the christmas tree

this was written by miami herald columnist leonard pitts an african american well go forward from this moment by leonard pitts its my job to have something to say they pay me to provide words that help make sense of that which troubles the american soul but in this moment of airless shock when hot tears sting disbelieving eyes the only thing i can find to say the only words that seem to fit must be addressed to the unknown author of this suffering you monster you beast you unspeakable bastard what lesson did you hope to teach us by your cowards attack on our world trade center our pentagon us what was it you hoped we would learn whatever it was please know that you failed did you want us to respect your cause you just damned your cause did you want to make us fear you just steeled our resolve did you want to tear us apart you just brought us together let me tell you about my people we are a vast and quarrelsome family a family rent by racial social political and class division but a family nonetheless were frivolous yes capable of expending tremendous emotional energy on pop cultural minutiae a singers revealing dress a ball teams misfortune a cartoon mouse were wealthy too spoiled by the ready availability of trinkets and material goods and maybe because of that we walk through life with a certain sense of blithe entitlement we are fundamentally decent though peace loving and compassionate we struggle to know the right thing and to do it and we are the overwhelming majority of us people of faith believers in a just and loving god some people you perhaps think that any or all of this makes us weak youre mistaken we are not weak indeed we are strong in ways that cannot be measured by arsenals in pain yes were in pain now we are in mourning and we are in shock were still grappling with the unreality of the awful thing you did still working to make ourselves understand that this isnt a special effect from some hollywood blockbuster isnt the plot development from a tom clancy novel both in terms of the awful scope of their ambition and the probable final death toll your attacks are likely to go down as the worst acts of terrorism in the history of the united states and probably the history of the world youve bloodied us as we have never been bloodied before but theres a gulf of difference between making us bloody and making us fall this is the lesson japan was taught to its bitter sorrow the last time anyone hit us this hard the last time anyone brought us such abrupt and monumental pain when roused we are righteous in our outrage terrible in our force when provoked by this level of barbarism we will bear any suffering pay any cost go to any length in the pursuit of justice i tell you this without fear of contradiction i know my people as you i think do not what i know reassures me it also causes me to tremble with dread of the future in the days to come there will be recrimination and accusation fingers pointing to determine whose failure allowed this to happen and what can be done to prevent it from happening again there will be heightened security misguided talk of revoking basic freedoms well go forward from this moment sobered chastened sad but determined too unimaginably determined the steel in us you see the steel in us is not always readily apparent that aspect of our character is seldom understood by people who dont know us well on this day the familys bickering is put on hold as americans we will weep as americans we will mourn and as americans we will rise in defense of all that we cherish so i ask again what was it you hoped to teach us it occurs to me that maybe you just wanted us to know the depths of your hatred if thats the case consider the message received and take this message in exchange you dont know my people you dont know what were capable of you dont know what you just started but youre about to learn

i just composed a somewhat lengthy email about the anniversary trip and then closed out lotus notes and checked discard changes so it is gone but not sent can you email me back your office phone number and if it is convenient for you i will give you call and use old fashioned technology
i know that you left a message with patti about contacting david eastlake i have sent email messages to him that must have been delivered as i did not get a message about undeliverable email i havent heard back from him the phone numbers on the contact sheet are the students numbers at school i have left a voice mail both for daniel jenkins and david during the week between christmas and new years knowing that it was unlikely that they would be in austin it would be great to have their home numbers as better contact numbers during school breaks i was on vacation the week before christmas and for two days last week and i admit that i did not contact any students while i was on vacation i will try their austin numbers this week again although classes dont start until next week they may come back to austin early similar situation with my ou students i have conversed by email since i did not have home numbers do you know when classes resume at ou i will try my students there this week again by phone in case they are returning to school early i had lunch with ted jacobs the week between christmas and new years it was a thank you for finding some orange bowl tickets that david and i purchased yes we were at the game and saw ou win the national championship i have an update from him on our list of ou candidates according to his understanding of some of the decisions they have made if you have a few minutes today give me a call and i can go over that with you since full time offers were changed did we appropriately change summer intern offers as well i didnt see anything in your emails about that let me know sally

i have completed internal feedback forms through the pep system for brent price bob hall and peggy hedstrom those appeared to be the only names that you included for which you wanted my input somehow from andreas voice mail message last week i had anticipated responding to more requests i thought perhaps input in working with wes within ena or melissa on sap those werent on my list within the pep system so i just wanted you to know that i have responded to the three that were there if there was intent for me to respond to any others they werent accessible in the system believe me i am not asking for more just wanted to be sure that what i saw in pep as a request matched your expectations in terms of my response sally
i saw kims response to stephen douglas but it left me short of comfort on a completion timeline or enough details around assurance on an on going basis that this will be kept up i sent the note below to kim i am sure that she manages well but i think that we should encourage her to step into full responsibility and to be able to effectively communicate that within the organization it is likely that when stephen reads her note that he will call me and tell me that he still doesnt know when this task will be completed that was his concern yesterday and kims note really doesnt address that if she doesnt have an estimated completion date then she should set a target date for having all of the info compiled and state that at that date she will be able to create a realistic timeline for completing the task kim must own and communicate effectively the solutions or i will be the one that gets the phone calls the ena organization must develop confidence in others on our team lets help kim earn that confidence by coaching her to imagine the info that the customers needs stephen and to clearly communicate information that addresses his needs thanks
to continue to keep you in the loop looks like mike is moving in the right direction on this sally
you should see this reply from mike it is more positive than the response from james new sounds as if they have not yet finished their document on required changes to processes systems commercial practices etc to move to a same day calculation of their books mike and i have talked about this as a longer term goal for the london office and i knew that he was working with james and others to come up with a plan and a timeline i expect to review that with mike when he has it in a draft form that warrants that discussion that is why you havent yet seen the document sally
i should have included you on this contact list i will remember to do so next time i will be in the office all of this week so please call me directly on any information needs you or team may have this week
we are making some progress with the timeliness of london information more to come
got your most recent message your observation is correct that the enron americas staff member on shawns team has not been involved to date with doorstep reviews or planning although shawn made an offer to michelle some time ago there was a long lead time for her arrival she did not start with the company until after thanksgiving since she started a couple of weeks ago wes and i have asked her to look into several specific findings from the most aa internal audit projects and to work with our staffs to provide some solutions to issues that were raised there simply has not been the time to date to expose her to doorstep after shawn and i meet see below i will briefly summarize for you the roles that all groups will play in the doorstep review process before we move forward i want to be sure that all parties agree on the purpose methodology participants and execution plan for this on going project

fyi would love to have your comments or suggestions

fyi lets discuss
in cleaning up emails i ran across this one that i had not yet read has james called and talke with you about enpower are his concerns in the memo accurate let me know sally

hope your long weekend was a good one uneventful on monday at least got your message last friday it seems as if kristin is more and more interested in the ebs role especially after her continuing discussions with jim fallon the timing of her trip to london is somewhat up in the air may be the end of this week may be next week i think it will still be good for you and kristin to talk in person kristin and todd are both very qualified and you would love working with both kristins established working relationship with jim fallon would definitely be a plus i dont want to lose both of them from ena however at the same time so i would suggest that we make it an either or propostion i got your message on housinglocation in houston i am headed out of the office soon for an offsite meeting hosted by enas office of the chairman i will call you on friday when i am back in the office and talk through some options on housing
approved sally
i scheduled this meeting in houston to best accomodate schedules of some of our enron speakers the hill country or even galveston was going to make it impossible for jeff skilling to join us i would look at this meeting as if it were to be held outside of town i have preliminarily reserved rooms for all of you at the wyndham warwick part of the reason for this forum is to meet and get to know your counterparts in other enron operating companies and from around the world if you can stay at the hotel this team building will probably be enhanced this memo is not to force you to pack your bags and stay at the hotel but to let you know that my budget for the event did include rooms for all of you for sunday and monday nights i hate the sunday thing but in trying to minimize the time out of the office for those who will travel from far away this best suited their schedules please let patti know on thursday whether or not you would like a room at the hotel to make it easier for you to fully participate
i am forwarding a message from a wellesley student which includes her resume lets make sure that she is on our interview schedule for our return visit in november i talked with her quite a bit before the presentation and was impressed with her she has followed up with phone calls and this email i am sending her some additional information on enron at her request to help familiarize her with the company her work experience to date has been with more traditional energy companies sally
did you get to check on lunch plans for thursday or friday next week with directs this looks like it could conflict
i did find one that i have not used you will just need to change the information at the top of the page
attached is your actual form i did not have a totally blank one to forward as i have actually done work on all evals on my disk so i am sending yours so that you can erase your data and use this as a template hope this works
hector has still referred to the key players under jeff gossett as managers however only one of these will kelly is a manager the remainder are senior specialists let me know if you would like to discuss any of this in detail we are potentially exposed for steve jackson to hire some of these players away steve is going to have deliverables at his new employer our competitor which will require that he have good people he will be moving to columbus ohio where he will not personally know anyone locally to hire he does know these risk specialists here and being young and single or childless their mobility factors could be high enron would not want to lose any other talent to steves new employer
hector the key employees that jeff has identified are senior specialists with the exception of will kelly if you remember these are the risk employees that i was concerned about when steve jackson tendered his letter of resignation steve will be taking a similar role with a competitor and it is not inconceivable that he might approach some enron employees to join him and help ensure his success with his new employer we dont want this to happen waiting until the end of november to implement an effective retention plan does not make sense please call me tomorrow and lets talk about how we can jump start this thanks sally
please keep this for reference as we create a holiday contact list thanks
i always compile a contact list for energy operations during the holidays thanksgiving christmas and new years just let me know who appropriate contacts will be especially for the dpr and mpr during the dates that you are out sounds as if you should see a white christmas sally
it is with regret that i have accepted steve jacksons letter of resignation from enron steve has made a choice to leave enron and to join another company in the industry i know that you will join me in thanking him for his many years of service to enron and the contributions that he has made his risk expertise and his knowledge of ena transactions will be missed as will his leadership on the gas team although steves official last day with the company is in two weeks today is his last day in the office he will be available by phone over the next two weeks if there are questions that you may have on any open items that you were covering with steve patti has his home number if you need that we will also plan a happy hour for steve and we will let you know when and where that will take place effective tomorrow jeff gossett will assume leadership of the gas risk group reporting to me jeff will join bob hall and leslie reeves as business controllers for natural gas to continue to work together to provide leadership for the processes controls people and systems that support all aspects of this key business for north america please join me in congratulating jeff on his new responsibilities
fyii will keep you posted
i had lunch with barry yesterday and suggested that they might benefit from attending these meetings hope you dont mind my extending that invitation sally
fyi
this memo apparently was already out on email when we were meeting in my office regarding confirmations the language regarding jeffs role on financial confirmations and settlements was left in the memo it wasnt clear to me when we met whether scott and leslie had talked while looking at a draft of the memo or whether she had seen this on email since you said that you had not seen this memo please follow up with scott leslie and jeff to ensure a common understanding around financial confirmations and settlements so that can be communicated within the organization there should not be confusion over who has responsibility for financial confirms and settlements this memo as sent will create that confusion thanks
is this a timeline for all of ena or just for the accounting group
this request is approved your request forms that you send still dont provide enough information in laymans terms so that i know what you are asking to be approved are we working on this
i can never tell from these things what they are asking to be approved since gregorys address looks as if he is at corp just let me know who he is and what i am being asked to approve please reply with history attached thanks sally
fyi
fyi yes my response was lengthy
would you please forward a copy of our current draft of operating standards to shawn thanks
fernley i think that you are right about easy access to the standards in fact at the global operations controllers gathering in houston in october we are going to roll out a website created for global risk operations the global standards will be one of the items included as well as contact lists for operations controllers worldwide calendars for all enron offices worldwide a what time is it there if i am here page etc i would like for this to be introduced at the offsite as surprise just a little bang out of the announcement so i would appreciate your not sharing this plan widely at this point however i thought that i would let you know so that we would not duplicate any efforts
this employee and his supervisor bob schorr do not report in to me someone else should be approving this requested access
it was good to see you in norman earlier this week as always i appreciated your attendance at the presentation and at coachs afterwards i am sure that it is rewarding for you to see former students such as jody and nate participating on the other side of the recruiting table you have done a great job in changing and promoting the program i am pushing lexi to resolve the question around interview dates for summer interns asap i have also left mike mcconnell a message to make him aware of the issue i should be able to get back with you next week hopefully with a change in our strategy if you do become aware of five ou texas tickets please let me know we will certainly purchase them i just made the assumption that all tickets may already be sold on another note david has worn his ou shirt to work and has gotten lots of compliments he has a number of people that have asked him about school shirts caps etc do you have a list of the schools that you can get merchandise for and the types of merchandise that you can get let me know we can probably place a few orders through you
please put this on my calendar i dont know if i will make it there but i would like for it to be on my calendar thanks
i have read this series of emails but i am not sure that i fully understand the issue did willie not do his job are there problems with how sap works are both of these an issue please let me know if we have a far reaching problem with sap and netting thanks sally
i updated that systems matrix recently in preparation for our much rescheduled meeting with aa on risk controls that is on my calendar for friday morning this week so i will bring copies with me to that meeting i have been publishing an ena operations report monthly since june to date i have been reviewing it with dave delainey fine tuning each month the types of information and format that he likes i will bring you a copy tomorrow and would like your input on content and format as well with the recent reorganization i am working with egm and eim to create the same report after we have mastered that here in houston over the next month or so i plan to share the format with london so that all of our wholesale businesses can use the same format in addition to these monthly operating reports we are working on a daily report to be operational by the end of the fourth quarter that will track compliance with our fundamental operating standards we are in the phase of determining the source of reporting systematic or manual and the frequency of reporting daily weekly monthly for all commodities and locations against the operating standards as we get this to a first draft stage i will share this with you as well as the timeline for full implementation sally
this employee and hisher manager bob schorr do not report in to me this approval should be sent to someone else
too late with your spreadsheet the instructions that we got from donna were that i should review the resumes pass them to brent for his review and then on to causey for his review considering our schedules and the large number of resumes to review that would have been an impossible task to complete by thursday at noon i received the resumes after lunch on tuesday just before leaving for the airport to catch the plane for oklahoma i asked patti to make a copy of the packet for brent and i knew that rick would not want to take the time to review the resumes without some organization and screening first i reviewed as many of the resumes as i could on the plane on the way back to houston today all of the liberal arts resumes and about one third of the business resumes and brent reviewed them last night after his training class we got those to rick today by noon as he was leaving the office i believe that rick will review what brent and i put together and then will pass the resumes along to you since you only emailed your spreadsheet this morning after brent and i had done our reviews you will have to cross reference the info on the spreadsheet with the selected resumes brent and i would have appreciated some organization and screening of the resumes as well i would suggest that in the future that your team should make copies of the resumes for everyone that you would like to have doing the review the plan of passing them from one person to another is not practical and i should not have had to make the copies for brent if you are going to ask vps and mds to help in this process in a very short time frame then i would suggest that you use their time wisely if someone from you team had organized the resumes into three groups by gpas or majors that would have given us a good starting point instead of a jumble of resumes two page resumes were not stapled together and there were a number of resumes of mbas included which should be considered for associates interviews not analysts interviews please give us organized information to react to not simply a jumble of data that we have to weed through all of us want to participate and to be as involved as possible in the recruiting process but we need to be able to rely on the program for some basic administrative and organizational work i send these suggestions with the intent of constantly bettering the program and with the intent of helping you to succeed in your role not being critical i hope that you will take these suggestions in that light brent and i and i am sure hunter too would have appreciated
this approval request is incomplete it does not include the name of this employees manager i do not know the employee and without the name of the manager i cant possibly approve this please get someone to complete this request
i am not trying to twist any arms with this question but is there anything we can do so that jody can make the presentation at ou since he was the top graduate from the energy management program at ou it would be great for him to be at the presentation next tuesday night i know that recruiting events can be a drain on staffing but it is also time well spent i do know that jody is in a role that has real day to day commitments so if there is not a feasible way to have someone calc a book for him i will understand i just wanted you to take a look at this thanks
i have asked enas compensation team within hr to conduct a compensation study for me for all positions from manager level through vice president this analysis will include employees who are dedicated to ena eim and egm it had been the plan to complete our compensation analysis by focusing on the manager level and above following the market analysis for senior specialists and below that was completed by yvonne land i learned recently that yvonne has left the company and that she had not begun the analysis for managers and above todd burke who recently joined enron will be conducting the market survey and compensation analysis i met with todd recently he has had wonderful experience with towers perin and watson wyatt and i feel that we are fortunate to have him devoted to this project please give sufficient thought and attention to requests from todd the quality and timeliness of your responses will directly impact the quality and timeliness of the analysis that i will receive from todd i think that you should each have a vested interest in the success of this project todd also plans to resurvey market information for senior specialists and below so that his view of compensation will be complete and timely for all of energy operations since we recently took action on compensation levels for key players at the senior specialist level and below i would not anticipate further adjustments for those levels as a result of todds review you should receive a message from todd in the next day or so in which he will detail steps in the compensation analysis and what your role will be sally

i heard today that curtis smith has resigned i am sure that both ot you know that curtis and jeremy wong were viewed by users as critical resources for erms support even at a stand still my team had great concern over the rumored loss of curtis andor jeremy and with the assumption that sitara will not go forward for valuation then erms really has become repositioned as one of our key strategic systems there is much to do to catch up if you will with changes and enhancements that were put on hold for several years during the sitara development stage and our business continues to grow and change rapidly requiring responsive enhancements on an on going basis i would like to get together to discuss the staffing plan for support of erms as soon as possible we need to understand how day to day production support will be managed and how development work will be effectively handled i will ask my assistant to set up a meeting as soon as possible
im trying again

have you had a chance to talk with dave b on any of this it might be helpful for you to put a call in to tom martin today to give him your phone number and to let him know that you are working closely with dave and that you are available for any questions nothing may come up but i think that tom would feel better with this gesture probably wouldnt hurt to log the same call or email in to the rest of the guys on the list that will give all of them a feeling of continuity with regard to information from dave on this project do you have contact information for brenda if not i would get that from yvette convey her assistant she is making the rounds with patrick conner and the corporate development team doing site visits on two additional paper mills that we may purchase thanks sally
wow thanks for copying me on these sally
it is good to be getting feedback on these standards after you have received all responses i will be curious as to the number and nature of changes suggested i think for this to be powerful we will need to expect all commodities and all locations to meet common standards i will reserve judgement on that however pending your assessment once you have gotten all responses

as we said before i would like to be able to utilize todd hall for special projects from time to time i had mentioned to mike jordan that once todd completed his commoditylogic role that i thought that we could take some of his time to follow up on continental power issues which could fit nicely with some work he could do on weather in europe i dont know about the one month timeframe i would prefer that todd review the initiatives and determine the best way to proceed it might mean a couple of weeks over there for starters and then a follow up shorter trip a few weeks later i dont think that todd is keen on any elongated stays in europe particularly without the family can we still use todd 
thanks for taking the time to give me your input on the analyst program it will help to have that info in my meeting on friday

can you join me at this meeting i plan to talk with tom gros tomorrow to let him know that you will be the liasion with commoditylogic for energy operations then i thought that we could both attend this next meeting as a transition then its on your calendar after that sally
around midnight last night as i was creating our calendar for the week i ran through the incoming calls on caller id to find the piano teachers number i think that i saw yours did i miss you sometime this weekend with almost two teenagers in the house my personal messages have dropped very far down the list in importance i an never quite sure that i get messages that anyone calls feel free to call me at work or i can try to catch you during my commute tonight again hope you had a good weekend ours involved homework shoe shopping and continuing the search for new clothes our friend mo was in town from london and had burgers with us on saturday night sally
the employee for whom access if requested is not an employee of energy operations i would assume that with his supervisor listed as ed baughman that he is in a commercial origination group someone else should be reviewing and approving this
do we have these numbers for hector
can you arrange with bobbi thanks
can you help me on this can you give me the name of someone who sends messages from arsystemectcom to make matters even more frustrating when i tried to email back to get some clarification i got a message that said my email was undeliverable no contact name no phone number and no ability to email back im stuck thanks sally
fyi
this was great and i saw myself in a number of these it must be too long but that is who i am right now sally
did you mean to send that email to me it was greek to me and i assume that the sally it was meant for was that sally conover feels like a monday doesnt it sally
fyi i will be out of the office for the two meetings on wednesday this week i will be working in chicago monday and tuesday next week i will be back in the office on wednesday of next week todd tells me that a logo has been selected can you email that to me if not available electronically i will see it when i am back in the office next wednesday if no one has stepped in to a look at hours spent on the confirmation process and opportunities that may be presented there i will do that when i am back in the office next week my first move will be to sit down with jeff sorenson who leads the confirmation group to put some meat around the hours that james scribner sent you when we look at numbers of confirmations and compare several months of data we will be better able to identify which activities were stressed by increased business and which activities seemed to absorb increased business more easily i also think that jeff will be the best source of information about ideas on streamlining opportunities to simply life at enron and perhaps create value externally all of the advances made over the last several years auto confirm the decaf system auto faxing digitized signatures document scanning etc in our confirm group have been ideas generated by the business group and led by them for implementation no doubt jeff has some good ideas on where to go next
fyi
to my surprise i was chosen today to sit on a jury to hear a felony charge the judge believes that we can conclude the trial by end of the day on wednesday or perhaps on thursday i will be back here working after trial hours in the office and checking voice mail messages during breaks in the proceedings i will be back full time as soon as my civic duty is fulfilled enron is well presented in the court system over the next few days i sat by mark koenig in the jury assembly room today and he too was chosen to serve on another jury
fyi my reply to peggy
how do we get the right focus on support for calgary mark taylor wanted to hold up transferring confirm responsibility to calgary so we still need to provide excellent service to them while i can appreciate that diane is out that should actually be a red flag to us to pay even closer attention to the calgary stuff every screw up looks big to them and they cant understand how mistakes continue to happen while i know that they cant appreciate the vast number of transactions that the group is currently handling we still need to be able to deliver top notch service unfortunately we stub our toe enough with calgary that they view of our operation is one that delivers pretty poor to average service that is a terrible internal pr issue lets put our heads together on not just the confirm issue but all of our dealings with calgary so that we quickly turn around our error rate andor their perceptions and can sustain excellent service i am copying susan because she has dealt recently with an issue brought to our attention by rob milnthorp president of enron canada she responded to rob quickly and handled things professionally so she may not have shared the details with you at the time but now we need to look at all of our outstanding potential or past issues with calgary and get a solution in place she can fill you in on the details in that situation susan do you have any ideas on how we can reshape our image with calgary
james i didnt see your name on the distribution for this so im forwarding it to you patti
rob let me know if you get feedback from aec that does not indicate that they are getting what they need susan and bryce are both very capable and responsive so i am confident that aecs questions can be resolved quickly sally
just a reminder for monday to get this for me too bad they didnt deliver these thanks sally
i heard from andrew regarding the status of a business continuity plan attached is a short presentation that he sent me that i thought you would like to see any interest in meeting with andrew to get more detail i plan to get with him let me know and i will be glad to set something up
just a reminder about my being on vacation next week i also wanted to let you know that i gave your names as contacts while i am out sally
as mentioned i will be out on vacation next week this contact list should be helpful if you need anything while i am out sally
this looks good please send this wherever it should go thanks
what do these changes do to you sally
fyi
attached is bob supertys summary of the impact on the late noms today we do not anticipate any pipeline penalties on those pipes where the nom type is intraday there may be some pipeline imbalance created for us to work through the logistics staff will have a lot of work to do on thursday morning to contact customers asking them to renom on the pipes where our noms were late overall these pipelines worked well with us today let me know if you have any questions sally
since receiving your email message last monday on your needs in power i have spent three full days in prc meetings since then i have shared your needs with both todd hall and kristin albrecht my power business controller here in houston and have gotten their thoughts on how we could be of help sorry that i keep missing your calls i will be meeting with fernley but i will also try to reach you by phone tomorrow
it is too late in the day in london for me to catch you by phone today i will call you tomorrow and would like to throw out an idea regarding an on going resource for operations in london if you are comfortable with my idea then i can discuss it in person with fernley while he is here this week we have time on the calendar plus dinner this week
fyi this came as a surprise to me didnt know whether or not you knew about gingers departure sally
i have heard through the grapevine that you produce a weekly status report on the mg aquisition and assimilation would you please include me on that distribution list effective this week i believe that it is assumed that fernley dyson will have day to day responsibility for this business once the aquisition is completed however in my role over global risk management operations i find myself fielding questions regarding our assessment of operations and any issues surrounding assimilation brent price who reports to me and is on temporary assignment in the london office has been keeping me updated on progress to date his return soon to houston however will create a potential information gap that the weekly status report may help to fill thanks in advance to your attention to this
approved please process thanks sally beck
i meant to send this to you sally
i interviewed analystassociate candidates in the office on saturday as did four other directorssenior directors from energy operations i completed the evaluations of the four candidates that i interviewed and submitted those but was unable to stay for the decision meeting after lunch due to commitments to attend a funeral i talked with ted bland this morning and he suggested that i provide you with a list of candidates that could be a fit in energy operations analysts tara piazze potential fit in one of my risk management operations teams joseph piotrowski aa consulting background would be a good fit for my operations team focused on eol these are ena employees i need to add more strength to this group charles ames currently works in back office for a brokerage firm wants to trade would like to have him in risk to learn the business and enrons risk books we could immediately benefit from his background while he learns enron and how we manage risk then he could add even more value in moving to a trading role if appropriate better fits as direct hires not analyst or associate based on work experience and fit mike perun vp of small bank ted brought him in with my group in mind two of my directors interviewed him on saturday wed like to consider him as a direct hire jason sukenik undergrad and masters degrees in accounting plus mba could be good fit as direct hire in as managerdirector based on experience associates ryan ngo i believe that kevin presto suggested him for my group adele pickens shes on my list need to research interviewers comments who suggested my group for an assignment for her i dont think that anyone from energy operations interviewed him or her jennifer bagwell apparently remarked to two interviewers that she did not want to trade would like to see if there is a fit for her in managing risk or operations let me know about next steps in this process i would be glad to talk about any of this in more depth
i got the memo from naomi that you sent first who is doug imrie does he have a strong background in trading operations will he be able to coordinate effective reviews from a controls perspective and will he be able to be the front runner on how mg runs its business so that we will get a jump start on how best to assimilate the business i think that this effort should be much broader than deal testing it should encompass assessing people processes controls systems support etc to do this quickly and effectively will require persons who are knowledgeable about daily trading operations i dont know naomis background but i wonder if she will be the right person to lead one of these efforts since she does not work in operations on a daily basis patrick conner left me a message today to be certain that we are plugged in with an appropriate team from ena to review the chicago and new york offices from the sound of naomis memo it looks as if andy cornfield is assume to have the us responsibility again i dont know andy should we circle the wagons and develop a plan for doorstep reviews that includes some others in the process particularly those that have been involved in some doorstep reviews to date and those that have daily operational experience i have also mentioned shona as a good resource as well
scott earnest announced in the staff meeting today that in a meeting he had earlier today with jeff shankman and vince kaminiski that jeff announced that he had gotten the nod from mark frevert to manage the lng book of business this sentence structure is bad but you get the drift that is probably what shankman has alluded to in terms of increased responsibility i will assume that is in addition to gas but i dont know that for sure scott has been working on setting up the risk books for lng working closely over the last several weeks with vince kaminski we need to talk about this business and the best way to support it have you had any conversations with jeff on this
i didnt know that you were talking to jennifer i had put her on the list of attendees at last thursdays meeting with tom gros he had asked about someone being included that had been involved with enron online i felt that she might be perfect to be involved in networks with her exposure to eol i dont know whether or not you realized that she was in the room for that conference call what is she going to do for you in gas we may be hardpressed to find another strong candidate for the networks project who has been as involved with eol sally
please pring attached presentation for me in color thanks
i have entered the following names into the performance review system as suggested reviewers commercial customers jeff shankman jim fallon gary hickerson direct reports brent price business controller natural gas kristin albrecht business controller power todd hall business controller merchant portfolio others rick causey ted murphy fernley dyson london
ditto
i assume that granting access for someone for whom lorraine becker is the supervisor should be approved by you i get hundreds of these many for employees outside energy operations thanks sally
please print for me on legal size paper thanks
i asked my new hire to suggest names of people that she knows that would be good for to consider hiring here is her response tony vasut had called her and asked for this list as well do you have him keyed in on our blitz effort for hiring of risk personnel or is he working on some other initiative i have not reviewed the names nor shonas comments in detail yet but i wanted to pass these along for inclusion in our efforts sally
fyi i believe that shona will prove to be a great asset to enron we are following up on her leads for talent sally

barry sent me a copy of the draft memo announcing his role within ebs since scott pleus is currently in that role and does have people reporting to him in ebs that are in trading operations i would suggest that the memo contain a mention of the transition example scott pleus is currently director of trading operations for ebs he will be transitioning to an origination role within ebs in mid may as barry pearce assumes his responsibilities for ebs the current trading staff for ebs will report to barry effective with his start date in may i also heard from barry today that todd lindholm let him know that he is out of the picture with regard to commercial support for bandwidth trading operations and that barry will report to john echols so sounds as if that is clarified

fyi this should make things easier in london as there will be one point person to focus on global i am not sure that her background will bring a lot to the table in the early stages but she did seem sharp when i met with her last week this announcement did surprise me a bit as when i last talked with fernley he was not leaning in the direction of utilizing tani in this role sally
kevin sweeney forwarded this message to me fernley may have made you aware of his decision with tani when you and he talked yesterday if not i thought that you might be interested in this sally

it didnt occur to me until seeing richards message that we might have a hole in communications with mary being out on an extended basis we should probably create a message on marys phone that refers callers to someone else ditto on email messages beth does it make sense for that referral to be james or you or vanessa others within our organization that may try to reach mary could have questions about global databases projects that joels group had been handling etc i am not trying to put this off on you if you dont think it is appropriate but james andor vanessa came to mind as possible contacts by copy to hector i also wonder if we should review incoming emails that have come to mary over the last several weeks to see if there are some internal requests to which we need to respond let me know what you think sally
does vanessa know anything about this i know that we had a definite interest several years ago in a system from siebel we shelved it at the time due to it resource constraints and philippes concern over costs in the meantime ees bought a license and uses this system i know that mary was resurrecting this with someone on her team she had recently reviewed it with brenda herod i believe this is one of the items that we listed in dallas as a need if we were to get heavily into providing services for others sally
please put this on my calendar i cant get this to print and it is too small for me to read

fyi see attachment for latest attempt at satisfying the ill defined if this is not on target we will keep working until it is sally
all eight students that we interviewed for the enron scholarship were great and we should actively be sure that we get them on our interview schedules next year when they are in the second year of the mba program i dont want to simply leave that to chance by encouraging them to consider us karens letter noted below is a good idea but we should augment that by getting these students names on our radar screen for next year i will find out who the recruiter is for ut mbas and i will get copies of the students resumes and my notes on where they could be a good fit to that recruiter sally
fyi sounds as if michelle is accepting do you have anything firm from her sally
i have tried but cannot get the attachment to open to look at the report produced by london do you have a hard copy that i can see i can get it from you during the risk forum luncheon today thanks

any feedback or interest please let me know sally
i have a stretch goal for the operations budget under enron americas to reduce costs by the end of the year to this end i have recently studied possible options for reaching the targeted savings to make the best decision on this i have reviewed functions within my team on the basis of core versus non core functions and the inherent cost versus value proposition as a result i made the decision last week to disband joel henenbergs team to fulfill the role of joel and his team in leading it initiatives we will lean on the appropriate it project managers and the business sponsorsend users joel and his team were told of this decision on friday afternoon last week our hr rep spent some time with the team explaining the corporate re deployment service that they all will be working through over the next few weeks let me know if you have any questions regarding this while it was a tough decision i feel comfortable having made it
as a result of the reorg announcement a couple of weeks ago this report should now go to philippe bibi or his assistant peggy mccurley louise is now in the office of the chair of enron americas philippe has assumed the role as chairman of enron net works since this report is a net works report please remove louise from the distribution list and add philippe and peggy effective immediately also i would like to review and perhaps edit the principal projectsdeals section each week before distribution what would be the most efficient way to get this done and into your hands in a timely way sally
this is the replacement meeting for the hot list meeting i have asked that you be included on the list of attendees sally
thanks patti
looks like a permanent cancellation to me at least for now we can work with wes on the best ways to stay abreast of developing deals that impact enron americas
email messages says to check website to determine whether or not dsl is available at my home however i dont see a spot on the website to check that information can you provide more details
just remember that the dpr is used as an accounting tool as well despite my constant reminders that it is a tool for reporting daily trading results and positions against board approved limits so do approach this as fact finding and then i would suggest reviewing any recommendations that you may have with wes colwell and the rac group before any changes are made looks like a good group i hope that all will attend and participate did pam do some due diligence for you before sending this email so that you know this date and time works for everyone keep me posted on progress sally
please change location of this meeting for this week only i would also change the notation for this recurring meeting to enw staff meeting with philippe with peggy mccurley as the contact thanks
please print attachment for me thanks
please change this on my calendar thanks
kathryn corbally senior director currently in investor relations is moving to connecticut soon to join her husband he has been working up there for the last six or eight months he was one of the group that defected from our weather derivatives team about a year ago she hopes to continue to work for enron has been talking with investor relations and some other groups that i cant remember and to do so either out of her home or in enrons new york office it struck me that depending upon needs at mgs new york office that kathryn could be someone for you to consider she came originally from the london office you may or may not find anyone still there that could give you some feedback on her in london she ran mid and back office that was in very early days for eel so most of the job was probably accounting she came to houston and has done a number of different things i think that she is well organized and control minded understands enrons business managing a group of people is probably not her strongest attribute i am not sure that people enjoy working under her that could be old news however there are a number of people here in houston that could probably give you a read on her based on very recent experience do you know of her just thought that i would mention her as a potential resource in new york dont know what your short and longer term needs are there she would definitely represent an enron point of view they have two small daughters she might be interested in something part time even could mean lower cost that way this idea may not have any merit or you may not have a need around metals if you do want to consider this i will be glad to help identify who you could go to for some fact finding around her let me know sally
fyi i will meet with james on friday when he is back from london to go over the change in reporting for him i gave his review the end of last week but didnt get to review the reporting change i will ask patti to let you know when i am meeting with james on friday wanted you to be in the loop on this particularly when we are getting in front of commercial guys i want this to be well done the training may be great i just wanted to make sure that james knew about avrils trip and that he was aware of the content and delivery on the training looks like he still has some homework to do sally

i couldnt agree with you more mike missed the point of our phone call this week it was not to discuss the fine points of doorstep process or etiquette the point was ownership of an integration process and deadlines that were missed and how telling that when asked bluntly about his comfort level with controls for us operations that mikes response was a deferral to marcelo i have a one hour conference call set up with mike tomorrow this is one of the things that we will discuss sally

shona thanks for your task force summary below is what i have already produced here from the london perspective should we not be looking to get more detail of exactly the reasons were especially for human errors and highlight those areas where the problems arise rather than grouping things together and in so doing losing the detail also we should try to get some trend information so that it is clear where we are improving or not as the case may be on both a general and specific book basis james
sally beck as usual when you agree with me i think that you are brilliant ted
i couldnt agree with you more mike missed the point of our phone call this week it was not to discuss the fine points of doorstep process or etiquette the point was ownership of an integration process and deadlines that were missed and how telling that when asked bluntly about his comfort level with controls for us operations that mikes response was a deferral to marcelo i have a one hour conference call set up with mike tomorrow this is one of the things that we will discuss sally
attached for your review are the fundamental operating standards and controls that have been developed by the wholesale services group these standards are to be met by all enron offices and by each functional group within the operations process qualitative standards should be viewed as the basic measures to be taken when opening a new office or trading a new commodity statistics measuring compliance with quantitative standards will be monitored on a daily basis and any issues that arise will be addressed immediately as business unit heads you play a critical role in working with operations to ensure that proper controls are in place and working effectively please review this document and let me know if you have any questions or wish to discuss further regards brent

and their tradespark page touts back office functions for end to end management
you need to go take the tour of this site i believe williams has put together what whalleys vision was a year ago httpwwwwilliamscustomerfirstcomindexjsp
please call with any questionscomments best regards
see the comment below on williams confirmation site sounds similar to what we are proposing on cl one question im exploring right now is whether we could save more money from an enron perspective and achieve greater marketability with the model that confirmcorp proposes with automated matching vs the commodity logicwilliams approach that depends on users reviewingapproving confirms weve simply put the current process online so to speak we need to push for a more radical changeimprovement on a faster timeline i still believe confirms is the correct area to be focusing on as i mentioned in our meeting with louise but we need to seriously review what we propose to deliver and how is confirmcorp a viable company to bring under the enron umbrella i think we should be concerned that late entry with less functionality will erode our ability to sign up customers i dont think each large marketer will want to log in to several sites to clear their confirmations with each of their large counterparties can we find out if williams has further plans for their service that would compete with commodity logic
shona thanks for the meeting yesterday i think the process does improve the transparency and accountability of issues raised after the call i mentioned to ted that the meetings might be more efficient if the specific issues identified during doorstep visits that underpin report comments were validated by the direct controller on point for the officebusiness in this case marcelo ted replied that no harm came from the current approach and to a certain degree i agree that it is good to get an immediate collective response to issues raised however i thought we could discuss this for future meetings it could be part of the how to do a doorstep review that my guys requested so they are ready to do their individual reviews next year will call later additionally i thought i would confirm with you the actions i took down marcelo and yourself to identifycommunciate the specific control concerns identified that were not part of the core tasks transfered marcelo to add these to existing process efficiencies such as systems improvements etc and give a full timeline for all doorstep issues tim to send details of outward bound commercial instructions and to validate that no specfic exceptions have been recorded to date marcelo to validate that no existing business activities conflict systematically with the above instructions all to prepare for full ny review so as to validate compensating controls exist and function in ny marcelo me to identify if any cultural issues are left from recent business communications on roles and responsibilities myself to ensure that doorstep issues are included within database and monitoring process on timelines happens will call later mike

dear sally just to keep you in the loop naomis group is responsible for all of the enron europe remote offices and is a great resource to keep us updated on what each office is really doing we are hoping her group can help us determine which offices have originationtrading or are near doing these types of activities as well as what offices have other activities we are putting together a short checklist that her team will fill out for each office based on that we can determine whether to scope the office into our doorstep review thanks shona
just thought i would pass this on the reporting team has been swamped the past few weeks with requests sheri
dear naomi as always good talking to you yesterday based on the discussions you and i have had recently cassandra and i are in the process of drafting a process whereby we receive information from you and your group to help update our understanding of the enron europe remote offices this will allow us to better determine which offices to scope into the doorstep review and hopefully lessen the doorstep work required from mikes resources ill send something to you early next week have a good weekend shona
dear ms beck i want to thank you for interviewing me for the analyst position last week i enjoyed meeting you and learning about your work my enthusiasm for the position and my interest in working for enron were strengthened as a result of the interview i believe that my background and experience fit nicely with the job requirements and i am sure that i could make a significant contribution to the firm i have not heard back yet and would appreciate any information you can give thank you irfan iqbal
hector and shanna my three outstanding reviews have been turned into hr this afternoon no other reviews are outstanding for my group thanks sheila
i would welcome the opportunity to discuss this with you both probably separately given our diaries i am keen to understand whether we have the same perceptions of the control process and of the timetable for moving forward to our shared vision i will try to call later today mike
look forward to participating is there an agenda for the offsite i was wanting to determine if any of my key team members may be invited to attend certain segments due to areas of interest andor making contacts across enron thank you meredith
i scheduled this meeting in houston to best accomodate schedules of some of our enron speakers the hill country or even galveston was going to make it impossible for jeff skilling to join us i would look at this meeting as if it were to be held outside of town i have preliminarily reserved rooms for all of you at the wyndham warwick part of the reason for this forum is to meet and get to know your counterparts in other enron operating companies and from around the world if you can stay at the hotel this team building will probably be enhanced this memo is not to force you to pack your bags and stay at the hotel but to let you know that my budget for the event did include rooms for all of you for sunday and monday nights i hate the sunday thing but in trying to minimize the time out of the office for those who will travel from far away this best suited their schedules please let patti know on thursday whether or not you would like a room at the hotel to make it easier for you to fully participate
i am forwarding a message from a wellesley student which includes her resume lets make sure that she is on our interview schedule for our return visit in november i talked with her quite a bit before the presentation and was impressed with her she has followed up with phone calls and this email i am sending her some additional information on enron at her request to help familiarize her with the company her work experience to date has been with more traditional energy companies sally
i did find one that i have not used you will just need to change the information at the top of the page
attached is your actual form i did not have a totally blank one to forward as i have actually done work on all evals on my disk so i am sending yours so that you can erase your data and use this as a template hope this works
hector has still referred to the key players under jeff gossett as managers however only one of these will kelly is a manager the remainder are senior specialists let me know if you would like to discuss any of this in detail we are potentially exposed for steve jackson to hire some of these players away steve is going to have deliverables at his new employer our competitor which will require that he have good people he will be moving to columbus ohio where he will not personally know anyone locally to hire he does know these risk specialists here and being young and single or childless their mobility factors could be high enron would not want to lose any other talent to steves new employer
here you go ladies i will forward any updates as they become available thanks brenda
hey guys can you help please i need an good accountant to help set up and run a real estate co location book for ebs full time senior specialist level ive tried the market but its thin can you help can you assign be somebody from corp or someplace else for the rest of the year thanks barry
please disregard previous message on global standards inadvertantly attached wrong file sorry for the confusion nancy
forgot to add you to the list pt
hector the key employees that jeff has identified are senior specialists with the exception of will kelly if you remember these are the risk employees that i was concerned about when steve jackson tendered his letter of resignation steve will be taking a similar role with a competitor and it is not inconceivable that he might approach some enron employees to join him and help ensure his success with his new employer we dont want this to happen waiting until the end of november to implement an effective retention plan does not make sense please call me tomorrow and lets talk about how we can jump start this thanks sally
please keep this for reference as we create a holiday contact list thanks

in an effort to be more proactive we have contacted each supervisor whose employee received a needs improvement ranking we have recommended that the supervisor do the following assess the employees performance determine if the employee has improved or still needs improvement prepare the necessary background material to present at prc for improvednon improved employees ensure supervisor is able to share specific examples about the improved employee ie accomplishments contributions or positive customer feedback document and contact human resources for needs improvement employees address chronic or poor performers immediately not wait until the prc process i have attached for your review a summary report the report contains a list of needs improvement employees and their status please let me know if you have any questions regards frank dejesus

fyi
heres a summary of our conversation so you have points to follow up with general status of the database model fix not represented need to incorporate into common design and standardize might cause some fix rework referential integrity not entirely enforced potential for bad data to develop snapshots from global databases are currently daily this can be easily changed to be more frequent but need to consider implementation as decision on direction of global as a part of commodity logic is made rate information not developed need integration with rate server or mkm preferably mkm need to define how mkm will be used whether just for index names or to obtain actual settlement prices or curves as well application development is not currently occurring on a single version of the database therefore some issues could arise as each development team migrates to the standard this needs to happen relatively quickly specific issues gfdpipemeterssnp probably need to add factype wh ite etc for possible use as validation in kx functionality gasdeallocationdtl this table refers to facility number rather than pipe and meter facility number is an enronism that no other company will recognize pipe and meter general should try to avoid using pipecd as key this value needs to be updateable as pipelines are bought and sold data for facilities is heavily dependent upon enron global facilities database in current design and functionality this needs revisiting as the decision surrounding global is made cpaddrvw this table references only internalcpid and contacttypecd in conjunction with addressid addresses are specific to internalcpid productcd dealnaturecd contacttypecd and regioncd need to add deal nature product and region to ensure correct address usage since many companies align their business along these determinants and addresses may vary counterparty there is a mixture of the usage of global counterparty some areas indicate a certain amount of independence from enrons global counterparty system by having a table to capture commodity logic information on a counterparty such as phone numbers credit ratings etc this would position cl to become independent at a later date yet commodity logic functions as a subset of enron networks and gcp must make entries to indicate the usage of a customer by enron networks to obtain an sap id and support payment processing through to sap so cl could not become independent without further functionality or process changes so why not put the added data requirements within gcp to start with if global moves to commodity logic then this design needs to be revisited for sure there should probably be some standardization between dependenceindependence whether or not cl separates from enron common data status is not included in the views being utilized by the applications i hope the views have been filtered for active status only show was going to check on this concept of mapping others codes to ours for processing is not supported anywhere in these tables perhaps that has been handled in an isolated manner in the fix design this will have to be there for internal release as well as external release this is critical to the hub concept i look forward to sitting in on your meetings surrounding these issues let me know if you have further questions
fyi yes my response was lengthy
would you please forward a copy of our current draft of operating standards to shawn thanks
fernley i think that you are right about easy access to the standards in fact at the global operations controllers gathering in houston in october we are going to roll out a website created for global risk operations the global standards will be one of the items included as well as contact lists for operations controllers worldwide calendars for all enron offices worldwide a what time is it there if i am here page etc i would like for this to be introduced at the offsite as surprise just a little bang out of the announcement so i would appreciate your not sharing this plan widely at this point however i thought that i would let you know so that we would not duplicate any efforts
this employee and his supervisor bob schorr do not report in to me someone else should be approving this requested access
sally please call me if you have any questions mike
fernley sally off and on with jackie gentles help i have pulled together a one page communication note on our fundamental operating standards itself a one page summary we are in the final stages of this process where we draft a cover letter for john which will introduce this for inclusion within globalflash the enron europe newsletter have you any thoughts on draft or cover note mike

i updated that systems matrix recently in preparation for our much rescheduled meeting with aa on risk controls that is on my calendar for friday morning this week so i will bring copies with me to that meeting i have been publishing an ena operations report monthly since june to date i have been reviewing it with dave delainey fine tuning each month the types of information and format that he likes i will bring you a copy tomorrow and would like your input on content and format as well with the recent reorganization i am working with egm and eim to create the same report after we have mastered that here in houston over the next month or so i plan to share the format with london so that all of our wholesale businesses can use the same format in addition to these monthly operating reports we are working on a daily report to be operational by the end of the fourth quarter that will track compliance with our fundamental operating standards we are in the phase of determining the source of reporting systematic or manual and the frequency of reporting daily weekly monthly for all commodities and locations against the operating standards as we get this to a first draft stage i will share this with you as well as the timeline for full implementation sally
this employee and hisher manager bob schorr do not report in to me this approval should be sent to someone else
too late with your spreadsheet the instructions that we got from donna were that i should review the resumes pass them to brent for his review and then on to causey for his review considering our schedules and the large number of resumes to review that would have been an impossible task to complete by thursday at noon i received the resumes after lunch on tuesday just before leaving for the airport to catch the plane for oklahoma i asked patti to make a copy of the packet for brent and i knew that rick would not want to take the time to review the resumes without some organization and screening first i reviewed as many of the resumes as i could on the plane on the way back to houston today all of the liberal arts resumes and about one third of the business resumes and brent reviewed them last night after his training class we got those to rick today by noon as he was leaving the office i believe that rick will review what brent and i put together and then will pass the resumes along to you since you only emailed your spreadsheet this morning after brent and i had done our reviews you will have to cross reference the info on the spreadsheet with the selected resumes brent and i would have appreciated some organization and screening of the resumes as well i would suggest that in the future that your team should make copies of the resumes for everyone that you would like to have doing the review the plan of passing them from one person to another is not practical and i should not have had to make the copies for brent if you are going to ask vps and mds to help in this process in a very short time frame then i would suggest that you use their time wisely if someone from you team had organized the resumes into three groups by gpas or majors that would have given us a good starting point instead of a jumble of resumes two page resumes were not stapled together and there were a number of resumes of mbas included which should be considered for associates interviews not analysts interviews please give us organized information to react to not simply a jumble of data that we have to weed through all of us want to participate and to be as involved as possible in the recruiting process but we need to be able to rely on the program for some basic administrative and organizational work i send these suggestions with the intent of constantly bettering the program and with the intent of helping you to succeed in your role not being critical i hope that you will take these suggestions in that light brent and i and i am sure hunter too would have appreciated
this approval request is incomplete it does not include the name of this employees manager i do not know the employee and without the name of the manager i cant possibly approve this please get someone to complete this request
i think this is a call sally might be interested in being in on can you make sure she is aware it is taking place
attached is my quick assessment of the var training
sally and brent i had noted last week that we were having alot of processing problems with sap and other new processesset ups i have gotten a commitment from janet tran and rena dsouza who works with janet on the sap team to work with us to resolve our issues below is a list of items which laurel has reviewed with rena sheila
fyi
i am not trying to twist any arms with this question but is there anything we can do so that jody can make the presentation at ou since he was the top graduate from the energy management program at ou it would be great for him to be at the presentation next tuesday night i know that recruiting events can be a drain on staffing but it is also time well spent i do know that jody is in a role that has real day to day commitments so if there is not a feasible way to have someone calc a book for him i will understand i just wanted you to take a look at this thanks
there was an incorrect formula in the previous version please review this version and let me know if you have any updates regards shona
sally and brent the write up below is based upon discussions jonathan le and kevin lee had with steve stock and jeremy wong jonathan and kevin are working on a new cash flow process for us which should help to insulate us from the current intra night process for the erms and enpower cash flows sheila
i have asked enas compensation team within hr to conduct a compensation study for me for all positions from manager level through vice president this analysis will include employees who are dedicated to ena eim and egm it had been the plan to complete our compensation analysis by focusing on the manager level and above following the market analysis for senior specialists and below that was completed by yvonne land i learned recently that yvonne has left the company and that she had not begun the analysis for managers and above todd burke who recently joined enron will be conducting the market survey and compensation analysis i met with todd recently he has had wonderful experience with towers perin and watson wyatt and i feel that we are fortunate to have him devoted to this project please give sufficient thought and attention to requests from todd the quality and timeliness of your responses will directly impact the quality and timeliness of the analysis that i will receive from todd i think that you should each have a vested interest in the success of this project todd also plans to resurvey market information for senior specialists and below so that his view of compensation will be complete and timely for all of energy operations since we recently took action on compensation levels for key players at the senior specialist level and below i would not anticipate further adjustments for those levels as a result of todds review you should receive a message from todd in the next day or so in which he will detail steps in the compensation analysis and what your role will be sally
attached is a draft doorstep budget for your review i will be here next week to update it for your comments regards shona

dear sally attached is the latest version of the summary it is complete but im still waiting for scott e to let me know if anything has been done in panama you mentioned yesterday that you wanted the offices rated i have put a rating in based on the number comments size of the office and severity of the comments and what i understand the general attitude of the office to be but you should probably take a look at it since you attended some of these reviews best regards shona

who are these guys and should someone from our group meet with them
here is jennifers message sheri
i just wanted to make sure you were aware of one thing in case it comes up on friday or you can bring it up if you would like the only real system issues we have outside of enrononline it resources are the bridge resources currenlty eol deals bridge to tagg sitara and enpower we have had some issues in the past trying to get bridge issues corrected and nail down reasons for bridge failures among other things the problem has arisen due to the fact that each bridge really only has one person that is fully capable of correcting problems and until last week these three individuals really did not have anyone defining the bridge as part of their day to day responsibilities when tom moore left early this year these guys were left in limbo luckily they were seldom out and all three of them were very good at getting back to us for the most part now for the good news jennifer and i had a meeting with richard burchfield last week the bridges are now part of his world this was initiated by a memo jennifer copied beth on regarding bridge failures i will forward this to you as well richard understands the importance of the bridge and ensured us that he will add some structure to this group it is especially critical when the sitara bridge goes down late morning and we are doing next day physical deals on enrononline i have a good working relationship with him from the old synergi days so i think this will be great for us i provided him copies of the it compliance flow charts related to the bridges so that he could gain an understanding of how they work since this meeting jennifer has contacted additional resources that richard referred us to and they have been very responsive one of the guys volunteered his pager and told us to call him any time regarding any bridge so that said hopefully our only issue is correcting itself due to jennifers perseverance apart from that we do have an item on our wish list enrononline it to simplify the messages that are sent across the bridges to hopefully speed up processing time right now the bridges have to do a lot of thinking to determine how to book certain deals we want to eliminate that thinking by adding a deal type identifier on the deal which will automatically tell the bridge what to do i can give you more details on this if youd like but this is short and sweet explanation let me know if you have any questions thanks st

sally over the past year or so enron has made a great impact at the university of oklahoma in a very short time we have become one of the employers of of choice within the college of business we have been able to do this by paying attention to details and going beyond the necessary we have formed great relationships and planted seeds that will reap benefits for years to come if we do not become complacent i for one am an example of the impression that enron has forged at ou i am here because i believe that enron represents one of the greatest opportunities in not only the energy industry but the but the business world in general i am sending this note because i believe we are taking steps that will lessen our momentum at the university of oklahoma i have learned that we will not be sponsoring any entertainment for our presentation this fall as you know last year we sponsored a hypnotist and a drama team for entertainment after our presentations being a student at the time i felt this was a great idea and i know that my fellow students enjoyed the presentations as well they felt that it was a great opportunity to gain insight from enron representatives as well enjoy the entertainment which we provided as i understand the aa program now takes the position that this does not provide any residual value for enron and does not warrant the expense i do not understand this reasoning and feel that there is great value in such an arrangement it places another selling point on our presentation and gives us a better opportunity to familiarize ourselves with upcoming talent this may seem like an insignificant detail but i hope we will see the value that this opportunity presents the students of the em program and the jc penney leadership program are expecting another exciting evening from enron and hate to see us fall short of these expectations it is very likely that if we do not sponsor this event one of our competitors will the competition for talent is growing and we can not allow ourselves to become overconfident in our recruiting efforts enron is a great place to work and we must take that image to campus i know that mr mcconnell is a very exciting speaker and will no doubt amaze those present that is why we should take this simple step to have as many potential leaders present as possible and continue our path to recruiting dominance at the university of oklahoma i am fully aware that you were the instrumental element in putting ou within enrons sights your involvement at ou is greatly appreciated and i hope you maintain your interest in the university of oklahoma please consider my views on this matter and express any concerns of your own to the analyst and associate program thank you jody crook
please set up a meeting with steve and beth as soon as we can i believe that beth is out sick at the present
i heard today that curtis smith has resigned i am sure that both ot you know that curtis and jeremy wong were viewed by users as critical resources for erms support even at a stand still my team had great concern over the rumored loss of curtis andor jeremy and with the assumption that sitara will not go forward for valuation then erms really has become repositioned as one of our key strategic systems there is much to do to catch up if you will with changes and enhancements that were put on hold for several years during the sitara development stage and our business continues to grow and change rapidly requiring responsive enhancements on an on going basis i would like to get together to discuss the staffing plan for support of erms as soon as possible we need to understand how day to day production support will be managed and how development work will be effectively handled i will ask my assistant to set up a meeting as soon as possible

as we said before i would like to be able to utilize todd hall for special projects from time to time i had mentioned to mike jordan that once todd completed his commoditylogic role that i thought that we could take some of his time to follow up on continental power issues which could fit nicely with some work he could do on weather in europe i dont know about the one month timeframe i would prefer that todd review the initiatives and determine the best way to proceed it might mean a couple of weeks over there for starters and then a follow up shorter trip a few weeks later i dont think that todd is keen on any elongated stays in europe particularly without the family can we still use todd

interesting information floating up from some detailed review work by tim says a lot about the way mg do business i think re ny we should ask the same questions what prepayments exist philip bacon seemed uncomfortable with the need for a dash for each prepayment on a contract add to this the absence of credit people in ny and we may have some issues although marcelo and others stressed the fact that concentrates appeared to move no product without a letter of credit which was then often discounted to realise cash shona we should also discuss the legal contract issue another comment yesterday from philip was that each of his concentrates contracts were unique whilst i can accept that each may be tailored to customer preferences they still need to be cacsed we should look at the enforceabilitylegal risk here whilst information prepayment risk for metals should come from london accessing any relevent inofrmation from ny may be helpful will call later 
fyi i will be out of the office for the two meetings on wednesday this week i will be working in chicago monday and tuesday next week i will be back in the office on wednesday of next week todd tells me that a logo has been selected can you email that to me if not available electronically i will see it when i am back in the office next wednesday if no one has stepped in to a look at hours spent on the confirmation process and opportunities that may be presented there i will do that when i am back in the office next week my first move will be to sit down with jeff sorenson who leads the confirmation group to put some meat around the hours that james scribner sent you when we look at numbers of confirmations and compare several months of data we will be better able to identify which activities were stressed by increased business and which activities seemed to absorb increased business more easily i also think that jeff will be the best source of information about ideas on streamlining opportunities to simply life at enron and perhaps create value externally all of the advances made over the last several years auto confirm the decaf system auto faxing digitized signatures document scanning etc in our confirm group have been ideas generated by the business group and led by them for implementation no doubt jeff has some good ideas on where to go next

fyi my reply to peggy
how do we get the right focus on support for calgary mark taylor wanted to hold up transferring confirm responsibility to calgary so we still need to provide excellent service to them while i can appreciate that diane is out that should actually be a red flag to us to pay even closer attention to the calgary stuff every screw up looks big to them and they cant understand how mistakes continue to happen while i know that they cant appreciate the vast number of transactions that the group is currently handling we still need to be able to deliver top notch service unfortunately we stub our toe enough with calgary that they view of our operation is one that delivers pretty poor to average service that is a terrible internal pr issue lets put our heads together on not just the confirm issue but all of our dealings with calgary so that we quickly turn around our error rate andor their perceptions and can sustain excellent service i am copying susan because she has dealt recently with an issue brought to our attention by rob milnthorp president of enron canada she responded to rob quickly and handled things professionally so she may not have shared the details with you at the time but now we need to look at all of our outstanding potential or past issues with calgary and get a solution in place she can fill you in on the details in that situation susan do you have any ideas on how we can reshape our image with calgary
just so that you are aware we continue to have problems with the financial confirm process from houston on more than one occasion confirmations have been sent to our counterparties prior to review by calgary attached is the most recent one we have been assured over and over that this will not happen again however it continues to happen luckily this confirmation went out without any errors in it i know that you are very busy but is there any way that you can make it a priority to get resolution on moving the financial confirmations to calgary
sally congratulations on your promotion to md shanna

dear sally since we may not be able to have our bi weekly meeting i thought id let you know whats going on dpr im working with london to determine how to report the mg dpr to us nothing has been decided yet as we are waiting on the risk management policies risk limits from our guys in london as you know plenty of vr questions have been coming our way and are somewhat difficult for mikes team to answer i talked with eugenio and he is in the process of putting together some vr analyticsgraphs mikes guys can easily create to answer simpler vr questions burton a book analyst in brents group is coming back to mikes dpr group to support gary stadler and work on the benchmark reports and curve validations jenifer bagwell has taken burtons place in brents group a while back eugenio created a database to capture information and allows book commodity analysis he has been showing this to business unit controllers the rac group but has not distributed it yet due to security issues currently the database does not restrict different users to different commodities power people can see gas and vice versa it will slow down the database considerably if these restrictions are put in but it may be necessary i think the business controllers would not share the information with commercial but im not sure about the analysts in the rac group id like to get your opinion on this doorstep ive updated the presentation to include places and planned visits for offices previously not visited and second offices visits for the next year donna ted richard l and i have a meeting scheduled to go over the follow up of the first visits ill update you after the meeting hope you had a good vacation regards

as a follow up to my message yesterday i have talked to george mcclellan who assured me that he is taking things in india slowly and that no coal transactions will be taking place in the near term i also talked to bill bradford who has been in discussions with the office regarding counterparty credit however nothing has been formalized regards shona
i appreciate the time you took yesterday getting me up to speed as to your business and where you are in the process of establishing risk operations i hope you found our meeting useful as the checklist is meant to serve as an overview of points that need to be addressed before any transactions are entered into i was wondering if a meeting with carole milind heidi and myself has yet been scheduled for friday at that time i think we need to lay out a road map of how the checklist items will be addressed and how i can best help you regards shona

i interviewed analystassociate candidates in the office on saturday as did four other directorssenior directors from energy operations i completed the evaluations of the four candidates that i interviewed and submitted those but was unable to stay for the decision meeting after lunch due to commitments to attend a funeral i talked with ted bland this morning and he suggested that i provide you with a list of candidates that could be a fit in energy operations analysts tara piazze potential fit in one of my risk management operations teams joseph piotrowski aa consulting background would be a good fit for my operations team focused on eol these are ena employees i need to add more strength to this group charles ames currently works in back office for a brokerage firm wants to trade would like to have him in risk to learn the business and enrons risk books we could immediately benefit from his background while he learns enron and how we manage risk then he could add even more value in moving to a trading role if appropriate better fits as direct hires not analyst or associate based on work experience and fit mike perun vp of small bank ted brought him in with my group in mind two of my directors interviewed him on saturday wed like to consider him as a direct hire jason sukenik undergrad and masters degrees in accounting plus mba could be good fit as direct hire in as managerdirector based on experience associates ryan ngo i believe that kevin presto suggested him for my group adele pickens shes on my list need to research interviewers comments who suggested my group for an assignment for her i dont think that anyone from energy operations interviewed him or her jennifer bagwell apparently remarked to two interviewers that she did not want to trade would like to see if there is a fit for her in managing risk or operations let me know about next steps in this process i would be glad to talk about any of this in more depth
i got the memo from naomi that you sent first who is doug imrie does he have a strong background in trading operations will he be able to coordinate effective reviews from a controls perspective and will he be able to be the front runner on how mg runs its business so that we will get a jump start on how best to assimilate the business i think that this effort should be much broader than deal testing it should encompass assessing people processes controls systems support etc to do this quickly and effectively will require persons who are knowledgeable about daily trading operations i dont know naomis background but i wonder if she will be the right person to lead one of these efforts since she does not work in operations on a daily basis patrick conner left me a message today to be certain that we are plugged in with an appropriate team from ena to review the chicago and new york offices from the sound of naomis memo it looks as if andy cornfield is assume to have the us responsibility again i dont know andy should we circle the wagons and develop a plan for doorstep reviews that includes some others in the process particularly those that have been involved in some doorstep reviews to date and those that have daily operational experience i have also mentioned shona as a good resource as well
scott earnest announced in the staff meeting today that in a meeting he had earlier today with jeff shankman and vince kaminiski that jeff announced that he had gotten the nod from mark frevert to manage the lng book of business this sentence structure is bad but you get the drift that is probably what shankman has alluded to in terms of increased responsibility i will assume that is in addition to gas but i dont know that for sure scott has been working on setting up the risk books for lng working closely over the last several weeks with vince kaminski we need to talk about this business and the best way to support it have you had any conversations with jeff on this
i didnt know that you were talking to jennifer i had put her on the list of attendees at last thursdays meeting with tom gros he had asked about someone being included that had been involved with enron online i felt that she might be perfect to be involved in networks with her exposure to eol i dont know whether or not you realized that she was in the room for that conference call what is she going to do for you in gas we may be hardpressed to find another strong candidate for the networks project who has been as involved with eol sally

after last weeks volatility in the natural gas market i think we all agreed it is imperative that the trading risk controls and reporting groups understand how eack group looks at risk and how we manage the process while our processes are generally good in times of extreme price andor volatility environments we all could be more coordinated it is apparent now that we must get together to look at all aspects of it resources and intraday price risk and var management since it seems these are not now but should be the same thing i would like to set up a meeting regarding these and other management issues and will be in touch i appreciate everyones help jeff

sally thank you for taking the time to see me when i was in houston and for lunch i am working on a detailed comprehensive plan of action to enact the changes we discussed re the settlement and confirmations procedures transfer due to the volume of work that was on my desk upon my return this is not coming together quite as quickly as i would like and therefore we are going to have to look at it piece by piece we need to issue a new authorised signatory list this week for enron australia energy and enron australia finance pty ltd due to changes in the dealer structure and therefore we have decided that this would be a good opportunity to make the change to the approval of confirmations as agreed we will have sydney office take over responsibility for signing all confirmations this means they are still prepared in sydney as they are now with the change of procedure being that they will now be signed in sydney and faxed from here to our clients the primary signatories will be the managing director paul quilkey or the chief financial officer heidi mason in the event of both being unavailable they will be signed by the senior legal counsel david minns the confirmation log will be maintained in its entirety by sydney office and will be held in a directory accessible by houston this will allow independent audit review to occur as required in order to implement this change we have prepared a new authorised signatories list which we are planning to distribute at the end of this week in the meantime could you please advise of what action needs to be taken in houston to ensure all the relevant areas are advised clearly a key individual will be sue frusco when i met with sue in houston we discussed briefly the fact that you and i had agreed that invoicing and confirmations would move to sydney but at that stage there was no timing raised sue seemed happy to stay with the current arrangements until such time as we implemented a change do you want me to advise sue or will someone from houston speak to her thanks heidi

barry sent me a copy of the draft memo announcing his role within ebs since scott pleus is currently in that role and does have people reporting to him in ebs that are in trading operations i would suggest that the memo contain a mention of the transition example scott pleus is currently director of trading operations for ebs he will be transitioning to an origination role within ebs in mid may as barry pearce assumes his responsibilities for ebs the current trading staff for ebs will report to barry effective with his start date in may i also heard from barry today that todd lindholm let him know that he is out of the picture with regard to commercial support for bandwidth trading operations and that barry will report to john echols so sounds as if that is clarified

wes as we discussed on friday i think that there is merit to your arguments regarding the release in prudency in north america however this may alter the way we articulate the relative liquidity of our positions to banks and ratings agencies de facto we will be saying that our balance sheet and income statement reflect an ability to liquidate gas and power in north america at the mid with no adverse effects while this may be true typically these types of institutions see the result of liquidating much more liquid portfolios ie they will not believe that we have perfect liquidity i believe that we can satisfy both accounting and credit considerations if we maintain an ability to calculate an orderly liquidation under a negative pricing scenario basically multiple horizon var against a liquidating position this is what we showed moodys last month the main difference is that the resulting number will be a hit to pl as opposed to having reserves against it this is a long way of saying that i think it would be a good idea to discuss prudency methodology with both rac and treasury once you have finalized a course of action ted
sally i tried to get on your calendar but you are busy this week so i decide to send you a very important e mail you told me to contact you if i was ever considering leaving my current job so i am doing so at this time i want to say that i have thoroughly enjoyed working with you and you are the most impressive employee at enron at any level i feel comfortable speaking with you and appreciate all of your advice i am not totally unhappy with the recruiting part of my job i just feel that i do not buy into everything that is happening in my group there are many necessary changes that are needed and i feel that the program is heading in an excellent direction i just want to get into more of a sales oriented part of enron because i feel that my strength is selling i would like to at least get an interview with enron broadband because i know that they are filling up there retail sales groups although i do not have all the technical experience i know people who have gone over there with no technical or no sales experience as you know it is who you know and i do not have a relationship with david cox or any of the retail folks in broadband i was hoping that you would give david a call and see if he could at least give me an interview in one of the retail groups brent has called over to david and i feel if you were to call also it would help sally let me know if this will be ok and i would like to get on your calendar to discuss further nobody in my group knows that i am looking for another job so please keep this confidential i can not tell how much i value your opinion and advice in matters especially like these thank you so much and i look forward to hearing from you soon george hope

i would definitely talk with wes colwell about doing the presentation on business analysis reporting i think that he would do a great job
in the west the relationship between regulators and businesses is based on control and sometimes conflict somewhat like prison guard vs inmates nevertheless in japan it has until recently been based on cooperation more like a coach and team the japanese understand that this relationship may not be the best for the nation as a whole and have begun changing it this process is disconcerting and has powerful emotions attached to it i thought you might find this article interesting since it shows some of the complexities inherent in this change that might not be readily apparent to westerners regards eugenio

sally congratulations on the promotion to managing director very well deserved continued success liz taylor
thank you for letting me read our market overview and business model for japan when i went to the exotic energy derivatives conference in december i met masayuki fujita who studies the japanese power market for the mitsubishi research institute we chatted about deregulation of the industry and about the entry of foreign companies into the market the japanese understand the need to deregulate the industry but want to avoid the pain that may be associated with it this process is very unfamiliar and uncomfortable for the japanese they see power as a matter of national security like agriculture so foreign entrants into the market will have to tread with care understanding and sophistication fujita is working on a report for the institute he has agreed to let me have copies of the non confidential portions when it is finished in the interim he sent me a copy of a presentation that i thought you might find interesting regards eugenio
hi sally congratulations on your promotion i was hoping to congratulate you in person while you were in london but you seemed really busy every time you walked through our area i was on the phone hope to catch up with you next week when i visit houston best wishes amita

steve i am still a little out of it from my travels but let me take a first shot at my reaction to this i think we ought to at least challenge the notion that the mark to market exposure is so arcane as to be dismissed generally time is of the essence in most contractual relationships and the value of that time should take into account both time value of money and the value of the underlying at critical times i think that rac should be deeply involved in setting negotiating strategy and be part of any decisions made i will add to this if and when the haze clears up ted
in response to some questions you had regarding cost to pursue the global intelligence project the project team has put together a ball park costing to let you know where we are and how things are proceeding i have also put together a high level status summary please review and let me know if you have any questions as mentioned in the document we are proceeding with project development until directed otherwise

in a frank discussion with barry i had to advise him that it will be very difficult for him to succeed in the role i proposed for him and indeed in his current role in the medium term he is standing in the cross hairs of a rifle sight one move and hes dead i have no doubt that we will find a role for this talented individual which will enable him to sustain the tremendous level of contribution that we are used to seeing from him of course it will mean that progress in developing our trading support operations will be slower than it otherwise would have been i shall be looking for a suitable candidate to fill the co ordination role as you know individuals of the necessary calibre and experience are rare fernley

tight time frame for mike co on metals deliverables raises the question around the timing of next weeks visit on metal will we divert critical resources from these efforts sally
it didnt occur to me until seeing richards message that we might have a hole in communications with mary being out on an extended basis we should probably create a message on marys phone that refers callers to someone else ditto on email messages beth does it make sense for that referral to be james or you or vanessa others within our organization that may try to reach mary could have questions about global databases projects that joels group had been handling etc i am not trying to put this off on you if you dont think it is appropriate but james andor vanessa came to mind as possible contacts by copy to hector i also wonder if we should review incoming emails that have come to mary over the last several weeks to see if there are some internal requests to which we need to respond let me know what you think sally
does vanessa know anything about this i know that we had a definite interest several years ago in a system from siebel we shelved it at the time due to it resource constraints and philippes concern over costs in the meantime ees bought a license and uses this system i know that mary was resurrecting this with someone on her team she had recently reviewed it with brenda herod i believe this is one of the items that we listed in dallas as a need if we were to get heavily into providing services for others sally
please ask sheri thomas if this person needs access to eol applications i dont recognize the names the name noted as manager is loyd will who is a commercial employee reporting to kevin presto thanks

as a result of the reorg announcement a couple of weeks ago this report should now go to philippe bibi or his assistant peggy mccurley louise is now in the office of the chair of enron americas philippe has assumed the role as chairman of enron net works since this report is a net works report please remove louise from the distribution list and add philippe and peggy effective immediately also i would like to review and perhaps edit the principal projectsdeals section each week before distribution what would be the most efficient way to get this done and into your hands in a timely way sally

kathryn corbally senior director currently in investor relations is moving to connecticut soon to join her husband he has been working up there for the last six or eight months he was one of the group that defected from our weather derivatives team about a year ago she hopes to continue to work for enron has been talking with investor relations and some other groups that i cant remember and to do so either out of her home or in enrons new york office it struck me that depending upon needs at mgs new york office that kathryn could be someone for you to consider she came originally from the london office you may or may not find anyone still there that could give you some feedback on her in london she ran mid and back office that was in very early days for eel so most of the job was probably accounting she came to houston and has done a number of different things i think that she is well organized and control minded understands enrons business managing a group of people is probably not her strongest attribute i am not sure that people enjoy working under her that could be old news however there are a number of people here in houston that could probably give you a read on her based on very recent experience do you know of her just thought that i would mention her as a potential resource in new york dont know what your short and longer term needs are there she would definitely represent an enron point of view they have two small daughters she might be interested in something part time even could mean lower cost that way this idea may not have any merit or you may not have a need around metals if you do want to consider this i will be glad to help identify who you could go to for some fact finding around her let me know sally

dear mechelle although i am still somewhat confused about goals and deliverables of the model project that we discussed last week i thought i would share some information with you that may help you better scope this project as i currently understand it aa wants to ensure that all databases spreadsheets etc are inventoried currently risk management is incharge of setting up curves and books in the source systems we are responsible for setting up the relevant curvebook in risktrac we have no access to the source systems we are changing this process by instead of being inserted in the middle of the process we are working with it to transfer over the responsibility of establishing curves and books in the source systems to ourselves at the moment we are concentrating on erms then will work with enpower and lastly exotic spreadsheets we are developing a process to validate all new curves the day they are created our global exception reporting captures books deals that do not make it into any of the var credit or dpr an inventory of active books in the rac website which all risk management personnel have access to is being created this is a short term fix until the counterparty book library initiative can meet our needs not before march we are putting a tool together to track all of the book requests ill keep you updated on our progress best regards shona

i just composed a somewhat lengthy email about the anniversary trip and then closed out lotus notes and checked discard changes so it is gone but not sent can you email me back your office phone number and if it is convenient for you i will give you call and use old fashioned technology
as referenced below we have this information lets meet tomorrow to go over an implementation approach
i know that you left a message with patti about contacting david eastlake i have sent email messages to him that must have been delivered as i did not get a message about undeliverable email i havent heard back from him the phone numbers on the contact sheet are the students numbers at school i have left a voice mail both for daniel jenkins and david during the week between christmas and new years knowing that it was unlikely that they would be in austin it would be great to have their home numbers as better contact numbers during school breaks i was on vacation the week before christmas and for two days last week and i admit that i did not contact any students while i was on vacation i will try their austin numbers this week again although classes dont start until next week they may come back to austin early similar situation with my ou students i have conversed by email since i did not have home numbers do you know when classes resume at ou i will try my students there this week again by phone in case they are returning to school early i had lunch with ted jacobs the week between christmas and new years it was a thank you for finding some orange bowl tickets that david and i purchased yes we were at the game and saw ou win the national championship i have an update from him on our list of ou candidates according to his understanding of some of the decisions they have made if you have a few minutes today give me a call and i can go over that with you since full time offers were changed did we appropriately change summer intern offers as well i didnt see anything in your emails about that let me know sally
sheri has told me that you made an announcement recently congratulations on the baby i hope that you are feeling well i am so happy for you and your husband my how your lives will change but how enriched they will be our three are so much fun i will also always be honest with expectant moms and say that a new baby is an incredible amount of work as well and that it sometimes takes a while to really enjoy the experience if you ever want some funny stories about adjusting to being a first time mom just let me know i would be glad to share my experience with you sally
fyi
i have completed internal feedback forms through the pep system for brent price bob hall and peggy hedstrom those appeared to be the only names that you included for which you wanted my input somehow from andreas voice mail message last week i had anticipated responding to more requests i thought perhaps input in working with wes within ena or melissa on sap those werent on my list within the pep system so i just wanted you to know that i have responded to the three that were there if there was intent for me to respond to any others they werent accessible in the system believe me i am not asking for more just wanted to be sure that what i saw in pep as a request matched your expectations in terms of my response sally
i saw kims response to stephen douglas but it left me short of comfort on a completion timeline or enough details around assurance on an on going basis that this will be kept up i sent the note below to kim i am sure that she manages well but i think that we should encourage her to step into full responsibility and to be able to effectively communicate that within the organization it is likely that when stephen reads her note that he will call me and tell me that he still doesnt know when this task will be completed that was his concern yesterday and kims note really doesnt address that if she doesnt have an estimated completion date then she should set a target date for having all of the info compiled and state that at that date she will be able to create a realistic timeline for completing the task kim must own and communicate effectively the solutions or i will be the one that gets the phone calls the ena organization must develop confidence in others on our team lets help kim earn that confidence by coaching her to imagine the info that the customers needs stephen and to clearly communicate information that addresses his needs thanks
to continue to keep you in the loop looks like mike is moving in the right direction on this sally
you should see this reply from mike it is more positive than the response from james new sounds as if they have not yet finished their document on required changes to processes systems commercial practices etc to move to a same day calculation of their books mike and i have talked about this as a longer term goal for the london office and i knew that he was working with james and others to come up with a plan and a timeline i expect to review that with mike when he has it in a draft form that warrants that discussion that is why you havent yet seen the document sally
i should have included you on this contact list i will remember to do so next time i will be in the office all of this week so please call me directly on any information needs you or team may have this week
we are making some progress with the timeliness of london information more to come

i wanted to give you a quick update on confirmlogic testing was done last week on the confirmlogic module on thursday we discussed with kathryn cordes and the confirmlogic it team the items that we had found that were show stoppers as far as releasing the product for beta testing some of the major items found were the inability to properly handle basis swaps for gas and inability to display meaningful index references for power they were pulling in a code rather than a description of the index the team worked on the fixes and migrated the code last night today during testing they found that the new code had actually caused problems with the fixed price and volume information which was working previously i talked to kathryn and she said that the were rebuilding the code she said that someone had tested the fix last night and everything worked fine we plan more testing in the morning they are doing a high level demo this thursday for beta customers just to introduce the module they were planning on having more extensive beta demos for each client starting next week but realize that those may have to postponed further we have told them that we would not sign off for beta testing until we were comfortable that the items that we identified were working we need consistent stable days of testing before i will feel comfortable overall we like the new streamlined version of the screens and feel that it will be a good product if they can work out the data display issues call with any questions kim theriot
team i have attached a memo that i would like to send to d hart setting out aeps outstanding action items in respect to the close please review and provide any comments eg additional actions for aep or revised status for enron that i may have missed thanks brian
so far we have not done any further testing on confirmlogic since early last week when we encountered the problems with the volume and price displays kathryn called me late on friday and said that they would let us know when we can resume testing we have not heard from them this morning their demo last thursday for the beta clients went well the customers that participated in the demo were reliant dynegy calpine and sempra sempra participated via video conference from enrons new york office dynegy immediately said that they were very interested and i heard that reliant called back and expressed their interest as well i will keep you posted on any further developments kim theriot
i just saw this presentation on envera and couldnt help but think this is the concept you were promoting yesterday as a data hubexchange seems like that is the envera strategy as well
shona to share with the others our telephone discussion the notification template was not my request it was requested directly by skilling i know your group is working hard to meet mangagement expectations and in accordance with your request below market risk is happy to help you transition into this revised reporting format by reviewing the template prior to your distribution until you are comfortable with the reporting requirements the new pl notification limits and limit changes that will be in effect next tuesday should dramatically decrease the number of notifications so that should help it probably makes sense to re distribute the policy to your business unit controllers and the traders so they understand the policy requirements another issue that we discussed yesterday is the source of the violation explanations these should be provided to you by the head trader of that commodity group under the policy that commodity group manager is responsible for compliance with the risk management policy for the commodities under his responsibility along with the head of the energy ops for that commodity group if the traders are not providing these explanations to you or to your counterparts ops desk head business unit controller ill be happy to send them an e mail explaining their compliance obligation under the policy why dont you talk to each of the business unit controllers consider whether a process is already in place for this feedback as i understand it is for global products for example and if youd like me to send an e mail to whoever youre having difficulty with i will just let me know who our market risk desk heads will be happy to review their explanations but the problem is they can see whether theyre short or long and how the market moved in comparison but its the trader that can and should explain why they took a position whether theyre adjusting it based on the market moves etc let me know what else i can do to help streamline the process regards cassandra
dear cassandra thanks for the message i believe it if fully understood by us and the individual risk management groups that explanations must be validated by the traders are you in addition saying that your group who has been very helpful in the past will no longer help us understand the cause of violationsnotifications to me this appears contrary to a team spirit attitude and not reflective of what you and i and vlady and i had discussed earlier today also we are working toward getting the memos out earlier and this is a real set back to that process thoughts to shona wilsonnaenronenron michael beniencorpenronenron chris abelhouectect daniel falconecorpenronenron cc veronica valdezhouectect sally beckhouectect subject limit violations and notifications process shona to share with the others our telephone discussion the notification template was not my request it was requested directly by skilling i know your group is working hard to meet mangagement expectations and in accordance with your request below market risk is happy to help you transition into this revised reporting format by reviewing the template prior to your distribution until you are comfortable with the reporting requirements the new pl notification limits and limit changes that will be in effect next tuesday should dramatically decrease the number of notifications so that should help it probably makes sense to re distribute the policy to your business unit controllers and the traders so they understand the policy requirements another issue that we discussed yesterday is the source of the violation explanations these should be provided to you by the head trader of that commodity group under the policy that commodity group manager is responsible for compliance with the risk management policy for the commodities under his responsibility along with the head of the energy ops for that commodity group if the traders are not providing these explanations to you or to your counterparts ops desk head business unit controller ill be happy to send them an e mail explaining their compliance obligation under the policy why dont you talk to each of the business unit controllers consider whether a process is already in place for this feedback as i understand it is for global products for example and if youd like me to send an e mail to whoever youre having difficulty with i will just let me know who our market risk desk heads will be happy to review their explanations but the problem is they can see whether theyre short or long and how the market moved in comparison but its the trader that can and should explain why they took a position whether theyre adjusting it based on the market moves etc let me know what else i can do to help streamline the process regards cassandra

we have figured out why the credit group is getting so many new counterparty names in gas the spreadsheets that they are getting that information from are for position purposes only on pipe optons the value is captured in tagg and therefore if both had the correct counterparty it would be doublecounting credit risk the spreadsheet download has a specific download that it has to follow which includes counterparty name which in this case had to be put in as new counterparty i am working with debbie to figure out how we can download those positions without showing a counterparty at all from the spreadsheet it will be done as quickly as possible thanks
call we talk about this some time soon thanks bob ill have heather set up a short meeting
currently i am receiving exception reporting from many of your groups in excel we have started to build a database to replace the excel reporting in order to make the reporting easy on you we would like to build the database around your current systems in order to do this you and people in your groups will be receiving calls from kelly tisman who is responsible for building the database please make some time to show her your systems and needs as far as the reporting is concerned attached is the list of people she is planning to contact if it needs updated please let kelly know thanks shona

did debbie talk with the two of you before putting together her memo is she raising this to me because she wasnt comfortable with the outcome of her conversations with you two or did she skip that step just curious before i send any type of response i would need details from you around the process for updates to entelligence and global counterparty surely one feeds the other sally

dear all attached is the curve validation for the month of november do not hesitate to call with any questions you might have regards maria teresa aguilera peon
this is the response i put together for louise this may be better done in person if so give me a call when you have time here is my vision of the two worlds enron and commodity logic there are two basic alternatives if you see commodity logic as an independent venture then we should build in independence in our communication of deal data the transaction store does this beths drivetrain project being led by john simmons will provide this in this model not every functionsystem currently performed will be supplanted by a commodity logic module complete reliance on commodity logic to provide deal data needed for these systems would certainly complicate the integration as commodity logic may reside outside the firewall the systemsfunctions we dont think well outsource to commodity logic are trade capture contracts valuation credit and sap functions additionally we would like to see the development of more reporting support for the dpr operations pricing model entelligence and sap warehouse data the implementation of a workflow issue tracking tool and an enron branded site for customer information this vision was arrived at by asking the question what would you never consider outsourcing either due to competitive advantage control issues or confidentiality i started shopping this vision around last week and will continue to do so this week to get feedback for finalization if the two are really one and will be managed as one going forward then certainly a single deal database could suffice in this case there should not be separately managed it functions as redundant development efforts may occur and we could focus the resources on the top priorities right now commodity logic is heavily dependent upon beths resources to provide the data from the legacy systems the work to do these data feeds competes with other priorities currently underway such as unify performance alberta open access for power etc i think it is important to note that we have two different requirements for deal data one to support commodity logic functions is transactional and near realtime in nature the second to support reporting functions is probably a batch end of day process the technical design of the two would be different to meet functional and performance requirements so in a combined world there would still probably be two sources of deal data one present on our network as separate messages for each deal that transactional systems build a listener to subscribe to and a second source in a warehouse for reporting either alternative can be approached however organizational alignment and priorities might be different further if the intent is to break commodity logic off into a separate entity then the first alternative is preferred to maintain arms length independence another alternative is to consider operations and commodity logic as a combined entity that is separate from enron that offers systems and back office services to enron and other industry players i think this may be what sally is envisioning if this is where we are headed then some of beths resources that are directly tied to support of operations systems should be combined with commodity logic resources so we can have a focus on coordinated priorities i believe this alternative has the same issues as the first in terms of what is outsourced eg becomes part of commodity logic and what remains proprietary and confidential to enron let me know your thoughts
as requested here is the log for today
sally i wondered if we needed to extend the special floor support schedule or if we needed to make it be an ongoing schedule of floor support please advise thanks zhiyong

see resolution memo from andy cornfield and llloyd fleming sent separately
sally brent fyi no action required this note and an earlier email forwarded separately highlights issues around some transactions originated within metals that arose due to misunderstanding of limits which was work in progress for andrew cornfield risk lloyd fleming rac and shane dallman fx desk reporting to gary hickerson working with the metal commercial mds on the subject of an exemption from corp policy for ir and fx hedging it is pleasing that people in the control environment picked up the issues on a timely basis but disappointing that a firm conclusion between the commerical groups on delegated limits took longer than anticipated if you need any detail please call mike
you might want to attend this meeting if you can we did some brainstorming today on what how a commodity logic payment module should be and came up with some options that are quite revolutionary it entails some risk but also has revenue potential as well we want to run it by both you and tom to see if this is a direction you want to head if youre not available then i can spend time with you to give you the overview
could there be other counterparties that have the same concern as hess you will have to explain to me what the issue was thanks sally
dear sally we have been preparing this information daily until the end of the year either nancy or i will send it to you the full blown exception reporting will start the first week of january including elevation of issues so you wont get it every day anymore when christy starts i also have a contractor currently developing an access database to capture all exception reporting info for the past few days i have been hoping to spend time following up on the issues not only in the deal capture arena but in all reporting once the markets calm down ill be able to do so best regards shona

id like to get together as a group and discuss both commodity logic dcaf projects and see if we can put together a joint high level vision for supporting the trade clearing functions here are the items id like to initially discuss commodity logic deliverables timing and perhaps a demo or screen shots to show where we currently are in our development current dcaf requests and current areas of pain communicated from the user side legal credit concerns or issues known at this time once we have put together a strawman or high level plan then lets follow up with the larger user community and see if this address the highest priority concerns that were brought up at the deal clearing jad session cheryl please set up an hour and a half meeting with the people addressed under cc above to discuss the subject listed above id like to meet asap and would be willing to buy lunch if that aids us in getting this scheduled sooner than later
i forgot to mention my commodity logic activities see revised version
this system was just implemented for ena etal as a global system we are working on convincing europe to incorporate into their envision plan there could be potential to include this in the commodity logic family as a way to aggregate and serve time series price information to users a direct competitor of this product would be fame energy which i looked at earlier this week on the surface it would appear our system is more robust than the one offered by fame
since this was a fix to a doorstep finding how do we react
scott with all our reporting changing to london office and now it appears some restructure of risk and the broadening of sallys role what are we going to do for the second report for our new risk manager justin den hertog he has taken over from alan he reports to me locally but functionally he would traditionally have reported to you on behalf of sallys area i assume this has now moved with the rest of us and would therefore be either james new or mike jordan in london can you please advise me via return email as we are working on our pep stuff reviews etc with thanks heidi

please read the following message from kathie grabstald and michelle vitrella in public relations the weekly electronic newsletter is a project that mark frevert requested and it is important that enron global markets be responsive when we are asked for information from our business units please pass along to kathie and michelle the name of a contact person in your group that will be responsible for providing updates for the weekly newsletter kathie has assured me that the person providing the information is not required to do the actual writing but provide bullet points which she will then prepare in paragraph form michelle will send a reminder message to the contact person when the updates are needed thank you for your assistance with this project
sally fyi having never worked with whalley before i may never hear back from him wed like to obtain documentation signed by skillingbuy authorizing the top traders for specific commodity groups lavoratosherriffshankman then well get those top traders to designate head traders and so on down the line if you have any insight as to the commodity group assignments listed below please let me know and since you probably see whalley often perhaps you could mention it i think shonas group wants to reclassify the dpr accordingly but theyre not certain on some of these either thank you cassandra
please note that the ets representative is dave mcellin sorry for the error
i have tried but cannot get the attachment to open to look at the report produced by london do you have a hard copy that i can see i can get it from you during the risk forum luncheon today thanks
sally plse see the attached summary that risk ops prepares for frevertsherriffbrown on enron europe every week do your business unit controllers prepare something like this for the americas egm eim that we could use in our weekly briefing to rick buy whats happening is we try to prepare our own analysis of the trading pl and it really doesnt make much sense to do that since ops is probably already doing it id love to get looped in to similar analyses for the other business units also do you know who id contact in ees ill call barry pearce for ebs thank you cassandra
sally as discussed before john has asked us to send out this reminder of our standards clearly as we gather the data for shonas daily reporting we will discuss with the office of the chair cheers mike

sally fyi i had greg forward a copy of the latest memo leslie
fyi
fyi forgot to cc you on this pt
hello folks brent and i have updated the agenda for the changes we made the other night i am sending this to you for your own use remember that we will walk through this again on sunday night to make sure were still on the right track please dont distribute the agenda or share it with the session participants im sure they are starting to ask the question so what are we going to do while were there in fact ive had folks ask me that already my typical response is to reiterate the goals of the session and explain that we will do a series of exercies in both large and small group formats and when they continue to press for more as ive found they typically do i politely let them know that more details will be shared when we kick off the session on monday morning now if they are curious about what an ase is and why they have to go to dallas for it you can cover that too or have them call me team i think were really close to being ready im going to spend the rest of the day pulling together our input documents so if you have anything you want included send it on let me know if you have any questions lisa p
thanks for your part in making this happen
scott with all our reporting changing to london office and now it appears some restructure of risk and the broadening of sallys role what are we going to do for the second report for our new risk manager justin den hertog he has taken over from alan he reports to me locally but functionally he would traditionally have reported to you on behalf of sallys area i assume this has now moved with the rest of us and would therefore be either james new or mike jordan in london can you please advise me via return email as we are working on our pep stuff reviews etc with thanks heidi
sally as seen from the chain of e mails below sydney is looking to me for some process changes can you offer guidance or tell me who to go to for advice sue
sally further to my message below of last week i am enclosing a copy of the new authorised signatories for houstons records can you please confirm that sue frusco has been advised of this change in the procedures as we will now start signing the confirmations from sydney regards heidi
sally thank you for taking the time to see me when i was in houston and for lunch i am working on a detailed comprehensive plan of action to enact the changes we discussed re the settlement and confirmations procedures transfer due to the volume of work that was on my desk upon my return this is not coming together quite as quickly as i would like and therefore we are going to have to look at it piece by piece we need to issue a new authorised signatory list this week for enron australia energy and enron australia finance pty ltd due to changes in the dealer structure and therefore we have decided that this would be a good opportunity to make the change to the approval of confirmations as agreed we will have sydney office take over responsibility for signing all confirmations this means they are still prepared in sydney as they are now with the change of procedure being that they will now be signed in sydney and faxed from here to our clients the primary signatories will be the managing director paul quilkey or the chief financial officer heidi mason in the event of both being unavailable they will be signed by the senior legal counsel david minns the confirmation log will be maintained in its entirety by sydney office and will be held in a directory accessible by houston this will allow independent audit review to occur as required in order to implement this change we have prepared a new authorised signatories list which we are planning to distribute at the end of this week in the meantime could you please advise of what action needs to be taken in houston to ensure all the relevant areas are advised clearly a key individual will be sue frusco when i met with sue in houston we discussed briefly the fact that you and i had agreed that invoicing and confirmations would move to sydney but at that stage there was no timing raised sue seemed happy to stay with the current arrangements until such time as we implemented a change do you want me to advise sue or will someone from houston speak to her thanks heidi

i wanted to give you a quick update on confirmlogic testing was done last week on the confirmlogic module on thursday we discussed with kathryn cordes and the confirmlogic it team the items that we had found that were show stoppers as far as releasing the product for beta testing some of the major items found were the inability to properly handle basis swaps for gas and inability to display meaningful index references for power they were pulling in a code rather than a description of the index the team worked on the fixes and migrated the code last night today during testing they found that the new code had actually caused problems with the fixed price and volume information which was working previously i talked to kathryn and she said that the were rebuilding the code she said that someone had tested the fix last night and everything worked fine we plan more testing in the morning they are doing a high level demo this thursday for beta customers just to introduce the module they were planning on having more extensive beta demos for each client starting next week but realize that those may have to postponed further we have told them that we would not sign off for beta testing until we were comfortable that the items that we identified were working we need consistent stable days of testing before i will feel comfortable overall we like the new streamlined version of the screens and feel that it will be a good product if they can work out the data display issues call with any questions kim theriot
heard from allan sommer today regarding the sap licensing question we do not need to amend our current sap license agreement for the outsourcing project as long as we are the caretakers of the data ie outside entities do not access data within our environment but rather access an extract of the data from it this should work well with the current plan allan further suggested that we keep kathy kokas from his group posted on our effort in case our plan changes he also mentioned that their group may be helpful in other ways thanks fred philipson
the below email is in regards to the cost charts sheri asked that i provide to greg piper the comment the goal for us is to put the information into a form that i can share with potential external counterparties on tuesday is why i am forwarding the email to you i will dig deeper to understand the purpose also sally the gas chart is for both financial and physical and the increase in cost for february is due to social security and unemployment taxes these cost were incorrectly recorded to our cost centers and will be reversed during march

a near term goal for midback office commercialization is as follows first we need to determine what each piece is in the midback office that can be commercialized and how we would separate these different pieces in other words how we separate risk reporting and general ledger and where we put it at enron how we put the physical gas nominations and power scheduling at the desks how we take the rest for gas and power andor financial and create processcoserviceco as a separate entity or within net works second once we know the different pieces can we separate them from a systems perspective i am assuming that separating people is straightforward third assuming we can separate things how we communicate back to the other parts in other words how we communicate information back to enrons sap system how we settle for enron if they want processco to do physical settlements how we receive information so we can deal capture and confirm etc all the linkages fourth how we create an agreement between processco and ews that defines payments service levels term etc that can be a model for other companies as well fifth how this all deals with commoditylogic and its business model sixth if we go alone or work with someone like arcordia after beths meeting finally how we originate these deals and charge for our service i know that alot of this is being done in different parts on different time schedules but i would like to get it all pulled together soon in the following format a draft of a contract between ews and processco or net works also a clear picture of what systems and functions would be in this entity also a recommendation on how enron maintains its risk reporting and general ledger as well as physical noms and scheduling and where that stays in enron and how those functions work with processco sheri thomas jeff harbert frank davis fred philipson and andrea crump are now full time reporting to tom on commercialization all have midback office experience and can help beth and sally with alot of this work before tom comes back from his cruise at the end of next week lets discuss monday thanks gp

sally thank you for taking the time to see me when i was in houston and for lunch i am working on a detailed comprehensive plan of action to enact the changes we discussed re the settlement and confirmations procedures transfer due to the volume of work that was on my desk upon my return this is not coming together quite as quickly as i would like and therefore we are going to have to look at it piece by piece we need to issue a new authorised signatory list this week for enron australia energy and enron australia finance pty ltd due to changes in the dealer structure and therefore we have decided that this would be a good opportunity to make the change to the approval of confirmations as agreed we will have sydney office take over responsibility for signing all confirmations this means they are still prepared in sydney as they are now with the change of procedure being that they will now be signed in sydney and faxed from here to our clients the primary signatories will be the managing director paul quilkey or the chief financial officer heidi mason in the event of both being unavailable they will be signed by the senior legal counsel david minns the confirmation log will be maintained in its entirety by sydney office and will be held in a directory accessible by houston this will allow independent audit review to occur as required in order to implement this change we have prepared a new authorised signatories list which we are planning to distribute at the end of this week in the meantime could you please advise of what action needs to be taken in houston to ensure all the relevant areas are advised clearly a key individual will be sue frusco when i met with sue in houston we discussed briefly the fact that you and i had agreed that invoicing and confirmations would move to sydney but at that stage there was no timing raised sue seemed happy to stay with the current arrangements until such time as we implemented a change do you want me to advise sue or will someone from houston speak to her thanks heidi

please call me once you have had a chance to read through the attached memo obviously this is a highly sensitive issue and is only being discussed on a need to know basis to minimize the chances of this becoming known outside of enron therefore i would prefer not to discuss this issue in your staff meeting let me know if thats a problem
after last weeks volatility in the natural gas market i think we all agreed it is imperative that the trading risk controls and reporting groups understand how eack group looks at risk and how we manage the process while our processes are generally good in times of extreme price andor volatility environments we all could be more coordinated it is apparent now that we must get together to look at all aspects of it resources and intraday price risk and var management since it seems these are not now but should be the same thing i would like to set up a meeting regarding these and other management issues and will be in touch i appreciate everyones help jeff

please pring attached presentation for me in color thanks
please disregard previous message on global standards inadvertantly attached wrong file sorry for the confusion nancy
i didnt know that you were talking to jennifer i had put her on the list of attendees at last thursdays meeting with tom gros he had asked about someone being included that had been involved with enron online i felt that she might be perfect to be involved in networks with her exposure to eol i dont know whether or not you realized that she was in the room for that conference call what is she going to do for you in gas we may be hardpressed to find another strong candidate for the networks project who has been as involved with eol sally
scott earnest announced in the staff meeting today that in a meeting he had earlier today with jeff shankman and vince kaminiski that jeff announced that he had gotten the nod from mark frevert to manage the lng book of business this sentence structure is bad but you get the drift that is probably what shankman has alluded to in terms of increased responsibility i will assume that is in addition to gas but i dont know that for sure scott has been working on setting up the risk books for lng working closely over the last several weeks with vince kaminski we need to talk about this business and the best way to support it have you had any conversations with jeff on this
i got the memo from naomi that you sent first who is doug imrie does he have a strong background in trading operations will he be able to coordinate effective reviews from a controls perspective and will he be able to be the front runner on how mg runs its business so that we will get a jump start on how best to assimilate the business i think that this effort should be much broader than deal testing it should encompass assessing people processes controls systems support etc to do this quickly and effectively will require persons who are knowledgeable about daily trading operations i dont know naomis background but i wonder if she will be the right person to lead one of these efforts since she does not work in operations on a daily basis patrick conner left me a message today to be certain that we are plugged in with an appropriate team from ena to review the chicago and new york offices from the sound of naomis memo it looks as if andy cornfield is assume to have the us responsibility again i dont know andy should we circle the wagons and develop a plan for doorstep reviews that includes some others in the process particularly those that have been involved in some doorstep reviews to date and those that have daily operational experience i have also mentioned shona as a good resource as well
i interviewed analystassociate candidates in the office on saturday as did four other directorssenior directors from energy operations i completed the evaluations of the four candidates that i interviewed and submitted those but was unable to stay for the decision meeting after lunch due to commitments to attend a funeral i talked with ted bland this morning and he suggested that i provide you with a list of candidates that could be a fit in energy operations analysts tara piazze potential fit in one of my risk management operations teams joseph piotrowski aa consulting background would be a good fit for my operations team focused on eol these are ena employees i need to add more strength to this group charles ames currently works in back office for a brokerage firm wants to trade would like to have him in risk to learn the business and enrons risk books we could immediately benefit from his background while he learns enron and how we manage risk then he could add even more value in moving to a trading role if appropriate better fits as direct hires not analyst or associate based on work experience and fit mike perun vp of small bank ted brought him in with my group in mind two of my directors interviewed him on saturday wed like to consider him as a direct hire jason sukenik undergrad and masters degrees in accounting plus mba could be good fit as direct hire in as managerdirector based on experience associates ryan ngo i believe that kevin presto suggested him for my group adele pickens shes on my list need to research interviewers comments who suggested my group for an assignment for her i dont think that anyone from energy operations interviewed him or her jennifer bagwell apparently remarked to two interviewers that she did not want to trade would like to see if there is a fit for her in managing risk or operations let me know about next steps in this process i would be glad to talk about any of this in more depth

this is the memo i was referring to 
heres a summary of our conversation so you have points to follow up with general status of the database model fix not represented need to incorporate into common design and standardize might cause some fix rework referential integrity not entirely enforced potential for bad data to develop snapshots from global databases are currently daily this can be easily changed to be more frequent but need to consider implementation as decision on direction of global as a part of commodity logic is made rate information not developed need integration with rate server or mkm preferably mkm need to define how mkm will be used whether just for index names or to obtain actual settlement prices or curves as well application development is not currently occurring on a single version of the database therefore some issues could arise as each development team migrates to the standard this needs to happen relatively quickly specific issues gfdpipemeterssnp probably need to add factype wh ite etc for possible use as validation in kx functionality gasdeallocationdtl this table refers to facility number rather than pipe and meter facility number is an enronism that no other company will recognize pipe and meter general should try to avoid using pipecd as key this value needs to be updateable as pipelines are bought and sold data for facilities is heavily dependent upon enron global facilities database in current design and functionality this needs revisiting as the decision surrounding global is made cpaddrvw this table references only internalcpid and contacttypecd in conjunction with addressid addresses are specific to internalcpid productcd dealnaturecd contacttypecd and regioncd need to add deal nature product and region to ensure correct address usage since many companies align their business along these determinants and addresses may vary counterparty there is a mixture of the usage of global counterparty some areas indicate a certain amount of independence from enrons global counterparty system by having a table to capture commodity logic information on a counterparty such as phone numbers credit ratings etc this would position cl to become independent at a later date yet commodity logic functions as a subset of enron networks and gcp must make entries to indicate the usage of a customer by enron networks to obtain an sap id and support payment processing through to sap so cl could not become independent without further functionality or process changes so why not put the added data requirements within gcp to start with if global moves to commodity logic then this design needs to be revisited for sure there should probably be some standardization between dependenceindependence whether or not cl separates from enron common data status is not included in the views being utilized by the applications i hope the views have been filtered for active status only show was going to check on this concept of mapping others codes to ours for processing is not supported anywhere in these tables perhaps that has been handled in an isolated manner in the fix design this will have to be there for internal release as well as external release this is critical to the hub concept i look forward to sitting in on your meetings surrounding these issues let me know if you have further questions

dear sally since we may not be able to have our bi weekly meeting i thought id let you know whats going on dpr im working with london to determine how to report the mg dpr to us nothing has been decided yet as we are waiting on the risk management policies risk limits from our guys in london as you know plenty of vr questions have been coming our way and are somewhat difficult for mikes team to answer i talked with eugenio and he is in the process of putting together some vr analyticsgraphs mikes guys can easily create to answer simpler vr questions burton a book analyst in brents group is coming back to mikes dpr group to support gary stadler and work on the benchmark reports and curve validations jenifer bagwell has taken burtons place in brents group a while back eugenio created a database to capture information and allows book commodity analysis he has been showing this to business unit controllers the rac group but has not distributed it yet due to security issues currently the database does not restrict different users to different commodities power people can see gas and vice versa it will slow down the database considerably if these restrictions are put in but it may be necessary i think the business controllers would not share the information with commercial but im not sure about the analysts in the rac group id like to get your opinion on this doorstep ive updated the presentation to include places and planned visits for offices previously not visited and second offices visits for the next year donna ted richard l and i have a meeting scheduled to go over the follow up of the first visits ill update you after the meeting hope you had a good vacation regards
when do you think they were going to tell us after the meeting

just so that you are aware we continue to have problems with the financial confirm process from houston on more than one occasion confirmations have been sent to our counterparties prior to review by calgary attached is the most recent one we have been assured over and over that this will not happen again however it continues to happen luckily this confirmation went out without any errors in it i know that you are very busy but is there any way that you can make it a priority to get resolution on moving the financial confirmations to calgary
how do we get the right focus on support for calgary mark taylor wanted to hold up transferring confirm responsibility to calgary so we still need to provide excellent service to them while i can appreciate that diane is out that should actually be a red flag to us to pay even closer attention to the calgary stuff every screw up looks big to them and they cant understand how mistakes continue to happen while i know that they cant appreciate the vast number of transactions that the group is currently handling we still need to be able to deliver top notch service unfortunately we stub our toe enough with calgary that they view of our operation is one that delivers pretty poor to average service that is a terrible internal pr issue lets put our heads together on not just the confirm issue but all of our dealings with calgary so that we quickly turn around our error rate andor their perceptions and can sustain excellent service i am copying susan because she has dealt recently with an issue brought to our attention by rob milnthorp president of enron canada she responded to rob quickly and handled things professionally so she may not have shared the details with you at the time but now we need to look at all of our outstanding potential or past issues with calgary and get a solution in place she can fill you in on the details in that situation susan do you have any ideas on how we can reshape our image with calgary

fyi i will be out of the office for the two meetings on wednesday this week i will be working in chicago monday and tuesday next week i will be back in the office on wednesday of next week todd tells me that a logo has been selected can you email that to me if not available electronically i will see it when i am back in the office next wednesday if no one has stepped in to a look at hours spent on the confirmation process and opportunities that may be presented there i will do that when i am back in the office next week my first move will be to sit down with jeff sorenson who leads the confirmation group to put some meat around the hours that james scribner sent you when we look at numbers of confirmations and compare several months of data we will be better able to identify which activities were stressed by increased business and which activities seemed to absorb increased business more easily i also think that jeff will be the best source of information about ideas on streamlining opportunities to simply life at enron and perhaps create value externally all of the advances made over the last several years auto confirm the decaf system auto faxing digitized signatures document scanning etc in our confirm group have been ideas generated by the business group and led by them for implementation no doubt jeff has some good ideas on where to go next
interesting information floating up from some detailed review work by tim says a lot about the way mg do business i think re ny we should ask the same questions what prepayments exist philip bacon seemed uncomfortable with the need for a dash for each prepayment on a contract add to this the absence of credit people in ny and we may have some issues although marcelo and others stressed the fact that concentrates appeared to move no product without a letter of credit which was then often discounted to realise cash shona we should also discuss the legal contract issue another comment yesterday from philip was that each of his concentrates contracts were unique whilst i can accept that each may be tailored to customer preferences they still need to be cacsed we should look at the enforceabilitylegal risk here whilst information prepayment risk for metals should come from london accessing any relevent inofrmation from ny may be helpful will call later 
fyi

as we said before i would like to be able to utilize todd hall for special projects from time to time i had mentioned to mike jordan that once todd completed his commoditylogic role that i thought that we could take some of his time to follow up on continental power issues which could fit nicely with some work he could do on weather in europe i dont know about the one month timeframe i would prefer that todd review the initiatives and determine the best way to proceed it might mean a couple of weeks over there for starters and then a follow up shorter trip a few weeks later i dont think that todd is keen on any elongated stays in europe particularly without the family can we still use todd

i heard today that curtis smith has resigned i am sure that both ot you know that curtis and jeremy wong were viewed by users as critical resources for erms support even at a stand still my team had great concern over the rumored loss of curtis andor jeremy and with the assumption that sitara will not go forward for valuation then erms really has become repositioned as one of our key strategic systems there is much to do to catch up if you will with changes and enhancements that were put on hold for several years during the sitara development stage and our business continues to grow and change rapidly requiring responsive enhancements on an on going basis i would like to get together to discuss the staffing plan for support of erms as soon as possible we need to understand how day to day production support will be managed and how development work will be effectively handled i will ask my assistant to set up a meeting as soon as possible
please set up a meeting with steve and beth as soon as we can i believe that beth is out sick at the present
sally over the past year or so enron has made a great impact at the university of oklahoma in a very short time we have become one of the employers of of choice within the college of business we have been able to do this by paying attention to details and going beyond the necessary we have formed great relationships and planted seeds that will reap benefits for years to come if we do not become complacent i for one am an example of the impression that enron has forged at ou i am here because i believe that enron represents one of the greatest opportunities in not only the energy industry but the but the business world in general i am sending this note because i believe we are taking steps that will lessen our momentum at the university of oklahoma i have learned that we will not be sponsoring any entertainment for our presentation this fall as you know last year we sponsored a hypnotist and a drama team for entertainment after our presentations being a student at the time i felt this was a great idea and i know that my fellow students enjoyed the presentations as well they felt that it was a great opportunity to gain insight from enron representatives as well enjoy the entertainment which we provided as i understand the aa program now takes the position that this does not provide any residual value for enron and does not warrant the expense i do not understand this reasoning and feel that there is great value in such an arrangement it places another selling point on our presentation and gives us a better opportunity to familiarize ourselves with upcoming talent this may seem like an insignificant detail but i hope we will see the value that this opportunity presents the students of the em program and the jc penney leadership program are expecting another exciting evening from enron and hate to see us fall short of these expectations it is very likely that if we do not sponsor this event one of our competitors will the competition for talent is growing and we can not allow ourselves to become overconfident in our recruiting efforts enron is a great place to work and we must take that image to campus i know that mr mcconnell is a very exciting speaker and will no doubt amaze those present that is why we should take this simple step to have as many potential leaders present as possible and continue our path to recruiting dominance at the university of oklahoma i am fully aware that you were the instrumental element in putting ou within enrons sights your involvement at ou is greatly appreciated and i hope you maintain your interest in the university of oklahoma please consider my views on this matter and express any concerns of your own to the analyst and associate program thank you jody crook

i just wanted to make sure you were aware of one thing in case it comes up on friday or you can bring it up if you would like the only real system issues we have outside of enrononline it resources are the bridge resources currenlty eol deals bridge to tagg sitara and enpower we have had some issues in the past trying to get bridge issues corrected and nail down reasons for bridge failures among other things the problem has arisen due to the fact that each bridge really only has one person that is fully capable of correcting problems and until last week these three individuals really did not have anyone defining the bridge as part of their day to day responsibilities when tom moore left early this year these guys were left in limbo luckily they were seldom out and all three of them were very good at getting back to us for the most part now for the good news jennifer and i had a meeting with richard burchfield last week the bridges are now part of his world this was initiated by a memo jennifer copied beth on regarding bridge failures i will forward this to you as well richard understands the importance of the bridge and ensured us that he will add some structure to this group it is especially critical when the sitara bridge goes down late morning and we are doing next day physical deals on enrononline i have a good working relationship with him from the old synergi days so i think this will be great for us i provided him copies of the it compliance flow charts related to the bridges so that he could gain an understanding of how they work since this meeting jennifer has contacted additional resources that richard referred us to and they have been very responsive one of the guys volunteered his pager and told us to call him any time regarding any bridge so that said hopefully our only issue is correcting itself due to jennifers perseverance apart from that we do have an item on our wish list enrononline it to simplify the messages that are sent across the bridges to hopefully speed up processing time right now the bridges have to do a lot of thinking to determine how to book certain deals we want to eliminate that thinking by adding a deal type identifier on the deal which will automatically tell the bridge what to do i can give you more details on this if youd like but this is short and sweet explanation let me know if you have any questions thanks st
here is jennifers message sheri
who are these guys and should someone from our group meet with them
the rovar sharpe ratio and risk return graphs we began publishing last week are now on the web based executive reports viewer along with the var limit usage graphs regards eugenio

dear sally attached is the latest version of the summary it is complete but im still waiting for scott e to let me know if anything has been done in panama you mentioned yesterday that you wanted the offices rated i have put a rating in based on the number comments size of the office and severity of the comments and what i understand the general attitude of the office to be but you should probably take a look at it since you attended some of these reviews best regards shona
attached is a draft doorstep budget for your review i will be here next week to update it for your comments regards shona
it was good to see you in norman earlier this week as always i appreciated your attendance at the presentation and at coachs afterwards i am sure that it is rewarding for you to see former students such as jody and nate participating on the other side of the recruiting table you have done a great job in changing and promoting the program i am pushing lexi to resolve the question around interview dates for summer interns asap i have also left mike mcconnell a message to make him aware of the issue i should be able to get back with you next week hopefully with a change in our strategy if you do become aware of five ou texas tickets please let me know we will certainly purchase them i just made the assumption that all tickets may already be sold on another note david has worn his ou shirt to work and has gotten lots of compliments he has a number of people that have asked him about school shirts caps etc do you have a list of the schools that you can get merchandise for and the types of merchandise that you can get let me know we can probably place a few orders through you
i have asked enas compensation team within hr to conduct a compensation study for me for all positions from manager level through vice president this analysis will include employees who are dedicated to ena eim and egm it had been the plan to complete our compensation analysis by focusing on the manager level and above following the market analysis for senior specialists and below that was completed by yvonne land i learned recently that yvonne has left the company and that she had not begun the analysis for managers and above todd burke who recently joined enron will be conducting the market survey and compensation analysis i met with todd recently he has had wonderful experience with towers perin and watson wyatt and i feel that we are fortunate to have him devoted to this project please give sufficient thought and attention to requests from todd the quality and timeliness of your responses will directly impact the quality and timeliness of the analysis that i will receive from todd i think that you should each have a vested interest in the success of this project todd also plans to resurvey market information for senior specialists and below so that his view of compensation will be complete and timely for all of energy operations since we recently took action on compensation levels for key players at the senior specialist level and below i would not anticipate further adjustments for those levels as a result of todds review you should receive a message from todd in the next day or so in which he will detail steps in the compensation analysis and what your role will be sally
congrats on a well deserved promotion
sally and brent the write up below is based upon discussions jonathan le and kevin lee had with steve stock and jeremy wong jonathan and kevin are working on a new cash flow process for us which should help to insulate us from the current intra night process for the erms and enpower cash flows sheila
there was an incorrect formula in the previous version please review this version and let me know if you have any updates regards shona
i am not trying to twist any arms with this question but is there anything we can do so that jody can make the presentation at ou since he was the top graduate from the energy management program at ou it would be great for him to be at the presentation next tuesday night i know that recruiting events can be a drain on staffing but it is also time well spent i do know that jody is in a role that has real day to day commitments so if there is not a feasible way to have someone calc a book for him i will understand i just wanted you to take a look at this thanks
sally congratulations on your promotion sincerely judy thorne

sally and brent i had noted last week that we were having alot of processing problems with sap and other new processesset ups i have gotten a commitment from janet tran and rena dsouza who works with janet on the sap team to work with us to resolve our issues below is a list of items which laurel has reviewed with rena sheila
attached is my quick assessment of the var training
i think this is a call sally might be interested in being in on can you make sure she is aware it is taking place
on your promotion wk
too late with your spreadsheet the instructions that we got from donna were that i should review the resumes pass them to brent for his review and then on to causey for his review considering our schedules and the large number of resumes to review that would have been an impossible task to complete by thursday at noon i received the resumes after lunch on tuesday just before leaving for the airport to catch the plane for oklahoma i asked patti to make a copy of the packet for brent and i knew that rick would not want to take the time to review the resumes without some organization and screening first i reviewed as many of the resumes as i could on the plane on the way back to houston today all of the liberal arts resumes and about one third of the business resumes and brent reviewed them last night after his training class we got those to rick today by noon as he was leaving the office i believe that rick will review what brent and i put together and then will pass the resumes along to you since you only emailed your spreadsheet this morning after brent and i had done our reviews you will have to cross reference the info on the spreadsheet with the selected resumes brent and i would have appreciated some organization and screening of the resumes as well i would suggest that in the future that your team should make copies of the resumes for everyone that you would like to have doing the review the plan of passing them from one person to another is not practical and i should not have had to make the copies for brent if you are going to ask vps and mds to help in this process in a very short time frame then i would suggest that you use their time wisely if someone from you team had organized the resumes into three groups by gpas or majors that would have given us a good starting point instead of a jumble of resumes two page resumes were not stapled together and there were a number of resumes of mbas included which should be considered for associates interviews not analysts interviews please give us organized information to react to not simply a jumble of data that we have to weed through all of us want to participate and to be as involved as possible in the recruiting process but we need to be able to rely on the program for some basic administrative and organizational work i send these suggestions with the intent of constantly bettering the program and with the intent of helping you to succeed in your role not being critical i hope that you will take these suggestions in that light brent and i and i am sure hunter too would have appreciated
this approval request is incomplete it does not include the name of this employees manager i do not know the employee and without the name of the manager i cant possibly approve this please get someone to complete this request

hi sally i just received the email announcing your promotion and wanted to take this opportunity to congratulate you regards bani
this memo apparently was already out on email when we were meeting in my office regarding confirmations the language regarding jeffs role on financial confirmations and settlements was left in the memo it wasnt clear to me when we met whether scott and leslie had talked while looking at a draft of the memo or whether she had seen this on email since you said that you had not seen this memo please follow up with scott leslie and jeff to ensure a common understanding around financial confirmations and settlements so that can be communicated within the organization there should not be confusion over who has responsibility for financial confirms and settlements this memo as sent will create that confusion thanks
here are the org charts there are two of them sally just send whichever you prefer the first is the entire group and the second is just managers thanks sheri

in an effort to be more proactive we have contacted each supervisor whose employee received a needs improvement ranking we have recommended that the supervisor do the following assess the employees performance determine if the employee has improved or still needs improvement prepare the necessary background material to present at prc for improvednon improved employees ensure supervisor is able to share specific examples about the improved employee ie accomplishments contributions or positive customer feedback document and contact human resources for needs improvement employees address chronic or poor performers immediately not wait until the prc process i have attached for your review a summary report the report contains a list of needs improvement employees and their status please let me know if you have any questions regards frank dejesus

please keep this for reference as we create a holiday contact list thanks
sally congratulations vince
hector the key employees that jeff has identified are senior specialists with the exception of will kelly if you remember these are the risk employees that i was concerned about when steve jackson tendered his letter of resignation steve will be taking a similar role with a competitor and it is not inconceivable that he might approach some enron employees to join him and help ensure his success with his new employer we dont want this to happen waiting until the end of november to implement an effective retention plan does not make sense please call me tomorrow and lets talk about how we can jump start this thanks sally
sally congratulations on your well deserved promotion to managing director take care heather
look forward to participating is there an agenda for the offsite i was wanting to determine if any of my key team members may be invited to attend certain segments due to areas of interest andor making contacts across enron thank you meredith

hey guys can you help please i need an good accountant to help set up and run a real estate co location book for ebs full time senior specialist level ive tried the market but its thin can you help can you assign be somebody from corp or someplace else for the rest of the year thanks barry
sally just wanted to say congratulations on your promotion kevin
here you go ladies i will forward any updates as they become available thanks brenda
hector has still referred to the key players under jeff gossett as managers however only one of these will kelly is a manager the remainder are senior specialists let me know if you would like to discuss any of this in detail we are potentially exposed for steve jackson to hire some of these players away steve is going to have deliverables at his new employer our competitor which will require that he have good people he will be moving to columbus ohio where he will not personally know anyone locally to hire he does know these risk specialists here and being young and single or childless their mobility factors could be high enron would not want to lose any other talent to steves new employer
attached is your actual form i did not have a totally blank one to forward as i have actually done work on all evals on my disk so i am sending yours so that you can erase your data and use this as a template hope this works

i scheduled this meeting in houston to best accomodate schedules of some of our enron speakers the hill country or even galveston was going to make it impossible for jeff skilling to join us i would look at this meeting as if it were to be held outside of town i have preliminarily reserved rooms for all of you at the wyndham warwick part of the reason for this forum is to meet and get to know your counterparts in other enron operating companies and from around the world if you can stay at the hotel this team building will probably be enhanced this memo is not to force you to pack your bags and stay at the hotel but to let you know that my budget for the event did include rooms for all of you for sunday and monday nights i hate the sunday thing but in trying to minimize the time out of the office for those who will travel from far away this best suited their schedules please let patti know on thursday whether or not you would like a room at the hotel to make it easier for you to fully participate
i would welcome the opportunity to discuss this with you both probably separately given our diaries i am keen to understand whether we have the same perceptions of the control process and of the timetable for moving forward to our shared vision i will try to call later today mike

shona thanks for the meeting yesterday i think the process does improve the transparency and accountability of issues raised after the call i mentioned to ted that the meetings might be more efficient if the specific issues identified during doorstep visits that underpin report comments were validated by the direct controller on point for the officebusiness in this case marcelo ted replied that no harm came from the current approach and to a certain degree i agree that it is good to get an immediate collective response to issues raised however i thought we could discuss this for future meetings it could be part of the how to do a doorstep review that my guys requested so they are ready to do their individual reviews next year will call later additionally i thought i would confirm with you the actions i took down marcelo and yourself to identifycommunciate the specific control concerns identified that were not part of the core tasks transfered marcelo to add these to existing process efficiencies such as systems improvements etc and give a full timeline for all doorstep issues tim to send details of outward bound commercial instructions and to validate that no specfic exceptions have been recorded to date marcelo to validate that no existing business activities conflict systematically with the above instructions all to prepare for full ny review so as to validate compensating controls exist and function in ny marcelo me to identify if any cultural issues are left from recent business communications on roles and responsibilities myself to ensure that doorstep issues are included within database and monitoring process on timelines happens will call later mike
see the comment below on williams confirmation site sounds similar to what we are proposing on cl one question im exploring right now is whether we could save more money from an enron perspective and achieve greater marketability with the model that confirmcorp proposes with automated matching vs the commodity logicwilliams approach that depends on users reviewingapproving confirms weve simply put the current process online so to speak we need to push for a more radical changeimprovement on a faster timeline i still believe confirms is the correct area to be focusing on as i mentioned in our meeting with louise but we need to seriously review what we propose to deliver and how is confirmcorp a viable company to bring under the enron umbrella i think we should be concerned that late entry with less functionality will erode our ability to sign up customers i dont think each large marketer will want to log in to several sites to clear their confirmations with each of their large counterparties can we find out if williams has further plans for their service that would compete with commodity logic
please call with any questionscomments best regards
you need to go take the tour of this site i believe williams has put together what whalleys vision was a year ago httpwwwwilliamscustomerfirstcomindexjsp
and their tradespark page touts back office functions for end to end management
fyi

from ted
attached for your review are the fundamental operating standards and controls that have been developed by the wholesale services group these standards are to be met by all enron offices and by each functional group within the operations process qualitative standards should be viewed as the basic measures to be taken when opening a new office or trading a new commodity statistics measuring compliance with quantitative standards will be monitored on a daily basis and any issues that arise will be addressed immediately as business unit heads you play a critical role in working with operations to ensure that proper controls are in place and working effectively please review this document and let me know if you have any questions or wish to discuss further regards brent
i couldnt agree with you more mike missed the point of our phone call this week it was not to discuss the fine points of doorstep process or etiquette the point was ownership of an integration process and deadlines that were missed and how telling that when asked bluntly about his comfort level with controls for us operations that mikes response was a deferral to marcelo i have a one hour conference call set up with mike tomorrow this is one of the things that we will discuss sally
sally beck as usual when you agree with me i think that you are brilliant ted
could you please ensure that sufficient resources are dedicated to fixing the current var calculation problem as soon as possible jenny stacey and vlady are spending a significant amount of time trying to repair the var calc model which is outside the scope of what we originally discussed in our meeting several weeks ago your attention to get quick resolution to this issue would be greatly appreciated thanks sally
shona thanks for your task force summary below is what i have already produced here from the london perspective should we not be looking to get more detail of exactly the reasons were especially for human errors and highlight those areas where the problems arise rather than grouping things together and in so doing losing the detail also we should try to get some trend information so that it is clear where we are improving or not as the case may be on both a general and specific book basis james
thanks patti
attached is the list we supplied to fran i will call with the ones that have moved on thanks bob
sally this is the feedback from sheri thomas direct reports it is well written and constructive i told dale that i would forward it to you and that i was sure that you would appreciate the feedback you may want to use it as part of your pep evaluation let me know if there is anything else that you would like for me to do with this information hope it puts a smile in your day hgm
steve stock has kindly volunteered to give us an overview of the current work in progress across enrons technology group i figured this would be a good first step in establishing the nature of the current medium term it strategy likely to be next week some time dp

sally plse see the attached summary that risk ops prepares for frevertsherriffbrown on enron europe every week do your business unit controllers prepare something like this for the americas egm eim that we could use in our weekly briefing to rick buy whats happening is we try to prepare our own analysis of the trading pl and it really doesnt make much sense to do that since ops is probably already doing it id love to get looped in to similar analyses for the other business units also do you know who id contact in ees ill call barry pearce for ebs thank you cassandra

sally fyi having never worked with whalley before i may never hear back from him wed like to obtain documentation signed by skillingbuy authorizing the top traders for specific commodity groups lavoratosherriffshankman then well get those top traders to designate head traders and so on down the line if you have any insight as to the commodity group assignments listed below please let me know and since you probably see whalley often perhaps you could mention it i think shonas group wants to reclassify the dpr accordingly but theyre not certain on some of these either thank you cassandra
please read the following message from kathie grabstald and michelle vitrella in public relations the weekly electronic newsletter is a project that mark frevert requested and it is important that enron global markets be responsive when we are asked for information from our business units please pass along to kathie and michelle the name of a contact person in your group that will be responsible for providing updates for the weekly newsletter kathie has assured me that the person providing the information is not required to do the actual writing but provide bullet points which she will then prepare in paragraph form michelle will send a reminder message to the contact person when the updates are needed thank you for your assistance with this project

sally fyi the first early pay trans for commoditylogic leslie
fyi this is not what we decided regarding attendance at the prc
scott with all our reporting changing to london office and now it appears some restructure of risk and the broadening of sallys role what are we going to do for the second report for our new risk manager justin den hertog he has taken over from alan he reports to me locally but functionally he would traditionally have reported to you on behalf of sallys area i assume this has now moved with the rest of us and would therefore be either james new or mike jordan in london can you please advise me via return email as we are working on our pep stuff reviews etc with thanks heidi
since this was a fix to a doorstep finding how do we react
this system was just implemented for ena etal as a global system we are working on convincing europe to incorporate into their envision plan there could be potential to include this in the commodity logic family as a way to aggregate and serve time series price information to users a direct competitor of this product would be fame energy which i looked at earlier this week on the surface it would appear our system is more robust than the one offered by fame
i forgot to mention my commodity logic activities see revised version
fyi

could there be other counterparties that have the same concern as hess you will have to explain to me what the issue was thanks sally
you might want to attend this meeting if you can we did some brainstorming today on what how a commodity logic payment module should be and came up with some options that are quite revolutionary it entails some risk but also has revenue potential as well we want to run it by both you and tom to see if this is a direction you want to head if youre not available then i can spend time with you to give you the overview
sally brent fyi no action required this note and an earlier email forwarded separately highlights issues around some transactions originated within metals that arose due to misunderstanding of limits which was work in progress for andrew cornfield risk lloyd fleming rac and shane dallman fx desk reporting to gary hickerson working with the metal commercial mds on the subject of an exemption from corp policy for ir and fx hedging it is pleasing that people in the control environment picked up the issues on a timely basis but disappointing that a firm conclusion between the commerical groups on delegated limits took longer than anticipated if you need any detail please call mike
see resolution memo from andy cornfield and llloyd fleming sent separately
is this what you have from aa as a formatinformation that they are comfortable with sally

as discussed this morning it was a quiet day best regards shona
please print this memo and attachments in color for me thanks sally
sally i wondered if we needed to extend the special floor support schedule or if we needed to make it be an ongoing schedule of floor support please advise thanks zhiyong
as requested here is the log for today
this is the response i put together for louise this may be better done in person if so give me a call when you have time here is my vision of the two worlds enron and commodity logic there are two basic alternatives if you see commodity logic as an independent venture then we should build in independence in our communication of deal data the transaction store does this beths drivetrain project being led by john simmons will provide this in this model not every functionsystem currently performed will be supplanted by a commodity logic module complete reliance on commodity logic to provide deal data needed for these systems would certainly complicate the integration as commodity logic may reside outside the firewall the systemsfunctions we dont think well outsource to commodity logic are trade capture contracts valuation credit and sap functions additionally we would like to see the development of more reporting support for the dpr operations pricing model entelligence and sap warehouse data the implementation of a workflow issue tracking tool and an enron branded site for customer information this vision was arrived at by asking the question what would you never consider outsourcing either due to competitive advantage control issues or confidentiality i started shopping this vision around last week and will continue to do so this week to get feedback for finalization if the two are really one and will be managed as one going forward then certainly a single deal database could suffice in this case there should not be separately managed it functions as redundant development efforts may occur and we could focus the resources on the top priorities right now commodity logic is heavily dependent upon beths resources to provide the data from the legacy systems the work to do these data feeds competes with other priorities currently underway such as unify performance alberta open access for power etc i think it is important to note that we have two different requirements for deal data one to support commodity logic functions is transactional and near realtime in nature the second to support reporting functions is probably a batch end of day process the technical design of the two would be different to meet functional and performance requirements so in a combined world there would still probably be two sources of deal data one present on our network as separate messages for each deal that transactional systems build a listener to subscribe to and a second source in a warehouse for reporting either alternative can be approached however organizational alignment and priorities might be different further if the intent is to break commodity logic off into a separate entity then the first alternative is preferred to maintain arms length independence another alternative is to consider operations and commodity logic as a combined entity that is separate from enron that offers systems and back office services to enron and other industry players i think this may be what sally is envisioning if this is where we are headed then some of beths resources that are directly tied to support of operations systems should be combined with commodity logic resources so we can have a focus on coordinated priorities i believe this alternative has the same issues as the first in terms of what is outsourced eg becomes part of commodity logic and what remains proprietary and confidential to enron let me know your thoughts
as requested
please review and e mail me your comments thanks
here is another competitor for online clearing we will be watching
sally thanks for your message this morning attached is an e mail that amy gambill sent out along with todds resume i was a little worried about forwarding todds resume directly to shona since her husband is an ermaudit manager at kpmg todd wants to make sure that noone at kpmg finds out that he is interested in enron i thought it would be better if you forwarded his resume to shona along with a note insuring that this is keep quiet please feel free to call me with any questions about todd and thanks again for your help i honestly believe that todd is a top performer at kpmg and would make a great addition to your team thanks john

in cleaning up emails i ran across this one that i had not yet read has james called and talke with you about enpower are his concerns in the memo accurate let me know sally
what is the latest on this one i gather that they are still using spreadsheets which in and of itself is not necessarily a problem are their positions not being captured and aggregated what does scott mills have to say about this sally
did debbie talk with the two of you before putting together her memo is she raising this to me because she wasnt comfortable with the outcome of her conversations with you two or did she skip that step just curious before i send any type of response i would need details from you around the process for updates to entelligence and global counterparty surely one feeds the other sally
sallywes below is the information on the technical sessions for the naba convention please look over the grid and see where there is a good fit for one of your people to lead a session based on what i heard on monday and because it is early in the game we should be able to provide a speaker for the ones we select this is a great opportunity to show case enron and enhance ourr brand identification thanks again for your support ted
 will it resources make a difference in what we need to deliver and how quickly we can do it someone must be giving credit the idea that if only we had it resources and that those resources are active on entelligence but are not helping us on other business basics sally

here it is

we have figured out why the credit group is getting so many new counterparty names in gas the spreadsheets that they are getting that information from are for position purposes only on pipe optons the value is captured in tagg and therefore if both had the correct counterparty it would be doublecounting credit risk the spreadsheet download has a specific download that it has to follow which includes counterparty name which in this case had to be put in as new counterparty i am working with debbie to figure out how we can download those positions without showing a counterparty at all from the spreadsheet it will be done as quickly as possible thanks
first of all i want to thank you and david for the two orange bowl tickets it has been a wonderful season for the sooners and it is certainly one i will not soon forget i am very excited about the chance to play for our seventh national championship texas has three just in case you were wondering but enough of that texas ou excuse me ou texas trash talking due to various reasons i have decided not to make the trip to miami none of my friends were going to be able to make it and it would have delayed some of my financial plans for the upcoming year i will nonetheless be there in spirit as i raise the roof at ruggles in enron field site of the ou watch party i believe that nate blackburn and rafael avila plan to make the trip and our still looking for tickets i have not mentioned your tickets as i thought you may have someone else in mind if by some stretch of the imagination you have trouble finding takers for the tickets please let me know once again thanks for the offer and i hope you and david have a great time in miami jody boomer sooner

i had a meeting today with milind laad financial controller anand s manager accounts and heidi hellman commercial associate person responsible for setting up the mid back office functions from the indian office in regards to their expected coal power liquid fuels and gas transactions we based the discussion around the checklist copy attached below the following is a summary of the meeting india is in the process of looking at potential deals but has not signed any contracts yet heidi and milind believe that in the near term india will only be doing a few structured deals and no trading heidi milind and i went over the checklist together and the results indicate that there is still a lot to do before india commences activities they have talked to a number of people about their plans but have not formalized anything as of yet also im not sure they yet appreciate the number of processes and procedures that must be established before any transactions have commenced i politely told milind that the enron way is to have systems processes procedures and controls established before any deals have commenced and that we have to make sure this happens lastly there are certain things that they told me that im a bit worried about the first is that a commercial person is responsible for setting up controls and processes i would like to talk to each about some of these as well as about what involvement you have had with india to date and what involvement you may have on an ongoing basis regards shona

got your most recent message your observation is correct that the enron americas staff member on shawns team has not been involved to date with doorstep reviews or planning although shawn made an offer to michelle some time ago there was a long lead time for her arrival she did not start with the company until after thanksgiving since she started a couple of weeks ago wes and i have asked her to look into several specific findings from the most aa internal audit projects and to work with our staffs to provide some solutions to issues that were raised there simply has not been the time to date to expose her to doorstep after shawn and i meet see below i will briefly summarize for you the roles that all groups will play in the doorstep review process before we move forward i want to be sure that all parties agree on the purpose methodology participants and execution plan for this on going project

i saw kims response to stephen douglas but it left me short of comfort on a completion timeline or enough details around assurance on an on going basis that this will be kept up i sent the note below to kim i am sure that she manages well but i think that we should encourage her to step into full responsibility and to be able to effectively communicate that within the organization it is likely that when stephen reads her note that he will call me and tell me that he still doesnt know when this task will be completed that was his concern yesterday and kims note really doesnt address that if she doesnt have an estimated completion date then she should set a target date for having all of the info compiled and state that at that date she will be able to create a realistic timeline for completing the task kim must own and communicate effectively the solutions or i will be the one that gets the phone calls the ena organization must develop confidence in others on our team lets help kim earn that confidence by coaching her to imagine the info that the customers needs stephen and to clearly communicate information that addresses his needs thanks
i have completed internal feedback forms through the pep system for brent price bob hall and peggy hedstrom those appeared to be the only names that you included for which you wanted my input somehow from andreas voice mail message last week i had anticipated responding to more requests i thought perhaps input in working with wes within ena or melissa on sap those werent on my list within the pep system so i just wanted you to know that i have responded to the three that were there if there was intent for me to respond to any others they werent accessible in the system believe me i am not asking for more just wanted to be sure that what i saw in pep as a request matched your expectations in terms of my response sally

kathryn corbally senior director currently in investor relations is moving to connecticut soon to join her husband he has been working up there for the last six or eight months he was one of the group that defected from our weather derivatives team about a year ago she hopes to continue to work for enron has been talking with investor relations and some other groups that i cant remember and to do so either out of her home or in enrons new york office it struck me that depending upon needs at mgs new york office that kathryn could be someone for you to consider she came originally from the london office you may or may not find anyone still there that could give you some feedback on her in london she ran mid and back office that was in very early days for eel so most of the job was probably accounting she came to houston and has done a number of different things i think that she is well organized and control minded understands enrons business managing a group of people is probably not her strongest attribute i am not sure that people enjoy working under her that could be old news however there are a number of people here in houston that could probably give you a read on her based on very recent experience do you know of her just thought that i would mention her as a potential resource in new york dont know what your short and longer term needs are there she would definitely represent an enron point of view they have two small daughters she might be interested in something part time even could mean lower cost that way this idea may not have any merit or you may not have a need around metals if you do want to consider this i will be glad to help identify who you could go to for some fact finding around her let me know sally

just remember that the dpr is used as an accounting tool as well despite my constant reminders that it is a tool for reporting daily trading results and positions against board approved limits so do approach this as fact finding and then i would suggest reviewing any recommendations that you may have with wes colwell and the rac group before any changes are made looks like a good group i hope that all will attend and participate did pam do some due diligence for you before sending this email so that you know this date and time works for everyone keep me posted on progress sally

all eight students that we interviewed for the enron scholarship were great and we should actively be sure that we get them on our interview schedules next year when they are in the second year of the mba program i dont want to simply leave that to chance by encouraging them to consider us karens letter noted below is a good idea but we should augment that by getting these students names on our radar screen for next year i will find out who the recruiter is for ut mbas and i will get copies of the students resumes and my notes on where they could be a good fit to that recruiter sally

the info from the outsourcing offsite has been loaded to the development environment of the global risk operations home page take a look i scanned and didnt see anything i wouldnt want to have in production but thought you might want to check before we move it into production once you say okay well move it out and then we need you to send the memo out that introduces the website httpgrodevcorpenroncom click the link and then select outsourcing ase studio workshop under the global heading in the body of the page
does vanessa know anything about this i know that we had a definite interest several years ago in a system from siebel we shelved it at the time due to it resource constraints and philippes concern over costs in the meantime ees bought a license and uses this system i know that mary was resurrecting this with someone on her team she had recently reviewed it with brenda herod i believe this is one of the items that we listed in dallas as a need if we were to get heavily into providing services for others sally
it didnt occur to me until seeing richards message that we might have a hole in communications with mary being out on an extended basis we should probably create a message on marys phone that refers callers to someone else ditto on email messages beth does it make sense for that referral to be james or you or vanessa others within our organization that may try to reach mary could have questions about global databases projects that joels group had been handling etc i am not trying to put this off on you if you dont think it is appropriate but james andor vanessa came to mind as possible contacts by copy to hector i also wonder if we should review incoming emails that have come to mary over the last several weeks to see if there are some internal requests to which we need to respond let me know what you think sally

patti i left cindy a message last week about attending the ncl convention later in april she says that ken and jeff encourage board membership in community activities and that taking time during the business week is part of that so according to cindy the days at convention will not be counted as vacation days i guess i would view this as if i were in la on business so no notation on time out of the office thanks

i wanted to give you a quick update on confirmlogic testing was done last week on the confirmlogic module on thursday we discussed with kathryn cordes and the confirmlogic it team the items that we had found that were show stoppers as far as releasing the product for beta testing some of the major items found were the inability to properly handle basis swaps for gas and inability to display meaningful index references for power they were pulling in a code rather than a description of the index the team worked on the fixes and migrated the code last night today during testing they found that the new code had actually caused problems with the fixed price and volume information which was working previously i talked to kathryn and she said that the were rebuilding the code she said that someone had tested the fix last night and everything worked fine we plan more testing in the morning they are doing a high level demo this thursday for beta customers just to introduce the module they were planning on having more extensive beta demos for each client starting next week but realize that those may have to postponed further we have told them that we would not sign off for beta testing until we were comfortable that the items that we identified were working we need consistent stable days of testing before i will feel comfortable overall we like the new streamlined version of the screens and feel that it will be a good product if they can work out the data display issues call with any questions kim theriot
team i have attached a memo that i would like to send to d hart setting out aeps outstanding action items in respect to the close please review and provide any comments eg additional actions for aep or revised status for enron that i may have missed thanks brian
so far we have not done any further testing on confirmlogic since early last week when we encountered the problems with the volume and price displays kathryn called me late on friday and said that they would let us know when we can resume testing we have not heard from them this morning their demo last thursday for the beta clients went well the customers that participated in the demo were reliant dynegy calpine and sempra sempra participated via video conference from enrons new york office dynegy immediately said that they were very interested and i heard that reliant called back and expressed their interest as well i will keep you posted on any further developments kim theriot

in a frank discussion with barry i had to advise him that it will be very difficult for him to succeed in the role i proposed for him and indeed in his current role in the medium term he is standing in the cross hairs of a rifle sight one move and hes dead i have no doubt that we will find a role for this talented individual which will enable him to sustain the tremendous level of contribution that we are used to seeing from him of course it will mean that progress in developing our trading support operations will be slower than it otherwise would have been i shall be looking for a suitable candidate to fill the co ordination role as you know individuals of the necessary calibre and experience are rare fernley

steve i am still a little out of it from my travels but let me take a first shot at my reaction to this i think we ought to at least challenge the notion that the mark to market exposure is so arcane as to be dismissed generally time is of the essence in most contractual relationships and the value of that time should take into account both time value of money and the value of the underlying at critical times i think that rac should be deeply involved in setting negotiating strategy and be part of any decisions made i will add to this if and when the haze clears up ted

thank you for letting me read our market overview and business model for japan when i went to the exotic energy derivatives conference in december i met masayuki fujita who studies the japanese power market for the mitsubishi research institute we chatted about deregulation of the industry and about the entry of foreign companies into the market the japanese understand the need to deregulate the industry but want to avoid the pain that may be associated with it this process is very unfamiliar and uncomfortable for the japanese they see power as a matter of national security like agriculture so foreign entrants into the market will have to tread with care understanding and sophistication fujita is working on a report for the institute he has agreed to let me have copies of the non confidential portions when it is finished in the interim he sent me a copy of a presentation that i thought you might find interesting regards eugenio
hello all apologies for any delays but carrie is out sick
in the west the relationship between regulators and businesses is based on control and sometimes conflict somewhat like prison guard vs inmates nevertheless in japan it has until recently been based on cooperation more like a coach and team the japanese understand that this relationship may not be the best for the nation as a whole and have begun changing it this process is disconcerting and has powerful emotions attached to it i thought you might find this article interesting since it shows some of the complexities inherent in this change that might not be readily apparent to westerners regards eugenio

wes as we discussed on friday i think that there is merit to your arguments regarding the release in prudency in north america however this may alter the way we articulate the relative liquidity of our positions to banks and ratings agencies de facto we will be saying that our balance sheet and income statement reflect an ability to liquidate gas and power in north america at the mid with no adverse effects while this may be true typically these types of institutions see the result of liquidating much more liquid portfolios ie they will not believe that we have perfect liquidity i believe that we can satisfy both accounting and credit considerations if we maintain an ability to calculate an orderly liquidation under a negative pricing scenario basically multiple horizon var against a liquidating position this is what we showed moodys last month the main difference is that the resulting number will be a hit to pl as opposed to having reserves against it this is a long way of saying that i think it would be a good idea to discuss prudency methodology with both rac and treasury once you have finalized a course of action ted
sally i will be in houston next week and was wondering if you could spare me some time to talk about the back office for australia i am the cfo in sydney and am currently running the settlements work done down here and i would also like to go over the results of the audit at the moment i have time available both on wed and thursday and would appreciate it if we could meet up on either of those days if you are available ac romero in cassandra schultzs office is co ordinating my schedule carol howes and i are meeting with harry bucalo on tuesday to look at weather settlements issues so we can also address the related control issues for this new product if that is convenient thanks heidi

ted tells me you guys have already taken action on this which greatly relieves me i did not want this procrastinated on i have a meeting scheduled with rick causey and will get up to speed on what exactly what has transpired prior to that meeting thanks for giving this your immediate attention rick
a doorstep inspection of this business was performed in accordance with our procedures and apparently this business is a disaster we need immediate action on this up to and including shutting it down this was the worst we have seen at enron and i dont even want to put in this email what i heard was going on there we need a coordinated solution here asap to avoid a real disaster if there isnt one already ill speak with rick causey here about what immediate action we should take but the more you guys can dig into this the better more to come rick
sally beck as usual when you agree with me i think that you are brilliant ted
from ted
shona thanks for the meeting yesterday i think the process does improve the transparency and accountability of issues raised after the call i mentioned to ted that the meetings might be more efficient if the specific issues identified during doorstep visits that underpin report comments were validated by the direct controller on point for the officebusiness in this case marcelo ted replied that no harm came from the current approach and to a certain degree i agree that it is good to get an immediate collective response to issues raised however i thought we could discuss this for future meetings it could be part of the how to do a doorstep review that my guys requested so they are ready to do their individual reviews next year will call later additionally i thought i would confirm with you the actions i took down marcelo and yourself to identifycommunciate the specific control concerns identified that were not part of the core tasks transfered marcelo to add these to existing process efficiencies such as systems improvements etc and give a full timeline for all doorstep issues tim to send details of outward bound commercial instructions and to validate that no specfic exceptions have been recorded to date marcelo to validate that no existing business activities conflict systematically with the above instructions all to prepare for full ny review so as to validate compensating controls exist and function in ny marcelo me to identify if any cultural issues are left from recent business communications on roles and responsibilities myself to ensure that doorstep issues are included within database and monitoring process on timelines happens will call later mike

i just wanted to make sure you were aware of one thing in case it comes up on friday or you can bring it up if you would like the only real system issues we have outside of enrononline it resources are the bridge resources currenlty eol deals bridge to tagg sitara and enpower we have had some issues in the past trying to get bridge issues corrected and nail down reasons for bridge failures among other things the problem has arisen due to the fact that each bridge really only has one person that is fully capable of correcting problems and until last week these three individuals really did not have anyone defining the bridge as part of their day to day responsibilities when tom moore left early this year these guys were left in limbo luckily they were seldom out and all three of them were very good at getting back to us for the most part now for the good news jennifer and i had a meeting with richard burchfield last week the bridges are now part of his world this was initiated by a memo jennifer copied beth on regarding bridge failures i will forward this to you as well richard understands the importance of the bridge and ensured us that he will add some structure to this group it is especially critical when the sitara bridge goes down late morning and we are doing next day physical deals on enrononline i have a good working relationship with him from the old synergi days so i think this will be great for us i provided him copies of the it compliance flow charts related to the bridges so that he could gain an understanding of how they work since this meeting jennifer has contacted additional resources that richard referred us to and they have been very responsive one of the guys volunteered his pager and told us to call him any time regarding any bridge so that said hopefully our only issue is correcting itself due to jennifers perseverance apart from that we do have an item on our wish list enrononline it to simplify the messages that are sent across the bridges to hopefully speed up processing time right now the bridges have to do a lot of thinking to determine how to book certain deals we want to eliminate that thinking by adding a deal type identifier on the deal which will automatically tell the bridge what to do i can give you more details on this if youd like but this is short and sweet explanation let me know if you have any questions thanks st

per your request amy
steve i am still a little out of it from my travels but let me take a first shot at my reaction to this i think we ought to at least challenge the notion that the mark to market exposure is so arcane as to be dismissed generally time is of the essence in most contractual relationships and the value of that time should take into account both time value of money and the value of the underlying at critical times i think that rac should be deeply involved in setting negotiating strategy and be part of any decisions made i will add to this if and when the haze clears up ted
michael here is my third report the password is green the appendices are also attached and the password for them is grey tks robert
hey brent jan erland has just called me from oslo he told you bjorn are due over there next week i guess im a little surprised no one told me as jan erland reports to me he is local office controller im assuming it will be a post helsinki type review right is there any particular things theyyou would like to look at or discuss as you know we operate some of the ibs functions from oslo and some from london im happy to discuss this further do your people need an introduction to the operation etc hope your well barry
jan erland has just called me from oslo he told me brent bjorn are due over there next week i guess im a touch surprised no one told me as jan erland reports to me he is local office controller im assuming it will be a post helsinki type review right is there any particular things theyyou would like to look at or discuss as you know we operate some of the ibs functions from oslo and some from london im happy to discuss this further do your people need an introduction to the operation etc hope your well barry
in a frank discussion with barry i had to advise him that it will be very difficult for him to succeed in the role i proposed for him and indeed in his current role in the medium term he is standing in the cross hairs of a rifle sight one move and hes dead i have no doubt that we will find a role for this talented individual which will enable him to sustain the tremendous level of contribution that we are used to seeing from him of course it will mean that progress in developing our trading support operations will be slower than it otherwise would have been i shall be looking for a suitable candidate to fill the co ordination role as you know individuals of the necessary calibre and experience are rare fernley
michael here is my second report the password is red tks robert
here is the abridged draft of the document for the presentation to joe sutton the expected loss calculation in the previous version was intended to show the outcome if we assume some recovery of amounts owing from vneshtopprom but until we re engage in the negotiation we can only speculate as to what this may be hence we have restricted the analysis to the maximum exposure please e mail kevin sweeney and me with any commentsamendments fernley

i appreciate the time you took yesterday getting me up to speed as to your business and where you are in the process of establishing risk operations i hope you found our meeting useful as the checklist is meant to serve as an overview of points that need to be addressed before any transactions are entered into i was wondering if a meeting with carole milind heidi and myself has yet been scheduled for friday at that time i think we need to lay out a road map of how the checklist items will be addressed and how i can best help you regards shona
i had a meeting today with milind laad financial controller anand s manager accounts and heidi hellman commercial associate person responsible for setting up the mid back office functions from the indian office in regards to their expected coal power liquid fuels and gas transactions we based the discussion around the checklist copy attached below the following is a summary of the meeting india is in the process of looking at potential deals but has not signed any contracts yet heidi and milind believe that in the near term india will only be doing a few structured deals and no trading heidi milind and i went over the checklist together and the results indicate that there is still a lot to do before india commences activities they have talked to a number of people about their plans but have not formalized anything as of yet also im not sure they yet appreciate the number of processes and procedures that must be established before any transactions have commenced i politely told milind that the enron way is to have systems processes procedures and controls established before any deals have commenced and that we have to make sure this happens lastly there are certain things that they told me that im a bit worried about the first is that a commercial person is responsible for setting up controls and processes i would like to talk to each about some of these as well as about what involvement you have had with india to date and what involvement you may have on an ongoing basis regards shona

see attachedsorry i didnt have time to get it into a graph format that looked nice kim
sally heres the first draft of a presentation geared toward prospective customers for our mid and back office services the message is more of a fact finding than sales message would appreciate your feedback jeff harbert has not given me his take on it as of yet thanks fred
in order to maximize the potential synergies between the various mid and back office functions to decrease replication errors and to increase communication standards are there any plans of creating a platform or reference center to bridge the differences between the systems processes and terminology of the various departments perhaps a common resource center offering access to on line system manuals and business unit overviews which currently exist only in paper form or in some cases within the actual system database the reason with enrons size and transaction volume many of the functions and the data managed by various groups within enron ie credit risk settlements volume management global contracts global counterparties global rates and the commercial systems are fragmented having participated in various process reviews and trouble shootingclean up projects there seems to be a large disconnect between groups operating in various systems these disconnects rather they be lack of information or understanding of how data flows between systems how the data managed within each system impacts other upstream or downstream systems or how the business processes within one groupsystem impacts the overall functionality of other groups create large cracks producing an opportunity for mismanaged data incomplete business reports and increased risk to enron the ideal objective increase communication standards through a better understanding of system data functionsrequirements and business processes decrease system downtime and replication errors through a better understanding of the data relationships between systems maximize department to department synergies left hand knows what the right hand is doing eliminate repetition and further reduce potential risks to enron due to informationbusiness process oversight
would love to walk you through this issue sometime

an interesting debate re npas and how to manage and control operational risk would be good to chat around this
fyi
sally i was scanning the brochure for the referenced conference and noticed that operational risk is being addressed by an enron corp employee kevin kindall i tried to locate him on our people finder but could not locate him i was just curious if you know who he is the brochure lists him as a manager although i can not attend due to the impact influence conference it is the type of conference i would love to attend in the future
this is interesting
i wanted to take a minute to commend all of you on a job well done in successfully integrating webmodal and implementing the operational processes for freight markets in a very short period of time i have been involved in several acquisitions over the years here at enron and i have never seen one that went as well as webmodal from an operational standpoint everyone came together as a team and ensured that integration timelines were met and that the business was allowed to continue its daily operations with minimal problems internally or to our external counterparties again congratulations on a great job thanks for all of your hard work brent
sally i did not know if meredith had provided these to you yet so i wanted to pass along these were the original budgets i know meredith is revising them to provide you a more accurate going forward view wade
there seems to be some confusion around which dpr captures credit reserve and consumption premium reserves and which balance sheet these items fall on my understanding in talking with both don and kevin is that since ees is on a go forward basis being granted origination which would be the residual after all reserves are applied that all prudencyreserve items will rest on the whees dpr the ees dpr will be just a single line net origination number we do need to capture the activity related to dsm in the ees dpr including some portion of credit reserve and drift but until we have the system capability to capture this it may just have to be part of the whole whees bucket this tracks with the idea that all future exposures be they be wholesale price movement tariff movement credit exposure etc be borne by ews if so they need the reserves to properly offset any realized activity the balance sheet reserves associated with these items already rest in the ledgers that are rolling up underneath ews now reflecting the positions on the whees dpr will make them consistent with how we are capturing them from an accounting perspective if anyone disagrees with this treatment please respond to all the parties above so we can resolve this issue if there are no objections i would recommend moving the credit reserve over at the next possible point wade ps this thinking only reflects how things are currently contemplated if the mix around what is with ews vs ees ie accounts receivable we may want to rethink the credit reserve portion
do either of you know if the canadian service deals are going to ubs or staying with the estate thanks bob
sally i thought you may be interested in seeing this as well well make sure you are kept in the loop also meredith and wanda have been the primary drivers behind the mid office issues wade

i would love to hear your thoughts on this based on my involvement with bridgeline i am very comfortable in this discussion the costs of the services is probably the weakest area as we do not have numbers yet on the costs we have been capturing in the e work orders for bridgeline however i do feel we will have very accurate numbers to provide in the future give me any other direction or thoughts you have
please read the meeting notice below janet dietrichs assistant set up this meeting at my request we want to present to the originators what it services are being provided to bridgeline discuss the value this can bring to ena and talk about other potential deals in the works the thought is to spur additional value creation for enron by offering services to our customers this would impact not only it but commercial operations as well having them understand what value the two groups can bring to the table and how important it is for our groups to be in on the front end of these deals is important so that these potential deals are negotiated structured correctly please plan on attending if your schedules permit tommy peggy please make sure this gets on philippes schedule

hi how is everyone doing busy busy busy i know i am currently in the middle of selecting our japan banking relationship and several questions have come up it is important that i understand how your trading settlements will work i have spoken to louise kitchen about enron online and where it fits in with our banking enron online does not interface with the banking it interfaces with a trading systemaccounting system what i need to know is what system is planned for enron japans accounting for the trading the accounting system you use will interface with our treasury system what it boils down to is the payment format that we will use to make local japanese payments may need special programming to meet the needs of the japanese english translation the accounting system used will need to interface with our treasury software to process the settlements we will need to interface with the bank please advise thank you pam perry
sally is there someone in your group that we can start discussing these items with
im meeting with rick causey tomorrow morning friday and hopefully sally will be attending as well ill brief you afterwards on our action plan cassandra
in the west the relationship between regulators and businesses is based on control and sometimes conflict somewhat like prison guard vs inmates nevertheless in japan it has until recently been based on cooperation more like a coach and team the japanese understand that this relationship may not be the best for the nation as a whole and have begun changing it this process is disconcerting and has powerful emotions attached to it i thought you might find this article interesting since it shows some of the complexities inherent in this change that might not be readily apparent to westerners regards eugenio
hello ejot i regret to inform you that this weeks conference call has been canceled the call will be reinstated next week though attached please see the our contact list with the new numbers and address thanks eddie
thank you for letting me read our market overview and business model for japan when i went to the exotic energy derivatives conference in december i met masayuki fujita who studies the japanese power market for the mitsubishi research institute we chatted about deregulation of the industry and about the entry of foreign companies into the market the japanese understand the need to deregulate the industry but want to avoid the pain that may be associated with it this process is very unfamiliar and uncomfortable for the japanese they see power as a matter of national security like agriculture so foreign entrants into the market will have to tread with care understanding and sophistication fujita is working on a report for the institute he has agreed to let me have copies of the non confidential portions when it is finished in the interim he sent me a copy of a presentation that i thought you might find interesting regards eugenio
wanda fyi joe hirl the trader in charge of setting up the tokyo trading office will be in houston next week and it would probably be a good idea if he could interview mark frank or whatever candidate we recommend for the controller position our controller for the sydney office will be up the following week and he should meet with her as well as that will enable him to get first hand knowledge of the remote trading office establishment issues weve addressed in australia sally did you decide on the one candidate you thought of when we met last we might want to arrange a meeting with him and joe also thanks cassandra

do you want me to ask tim to put you into the reporting frame work as well level with the european office of the chair
as presented to causey last friday regards richard
interesting information floating up from some detailed review work by tim says a lot about the way mg do business i think re ny we should ask the same questions what prepayments exist philip bacon seemed uncomfortable with the need for a dash for each prepayment on a contract add to this the absence of credit people in ny and we may have some issues although marcelo and others stressed the fact that concentrates appeared to move no product without a letter of credit which was then often discounted to realise cash shona we should also discuss the legal contract issue another comment yesterday from philip was that each of his concentrates contracts were unique whilst i can accept that each may be tailored to customer preferences they still need to be cacsed we should look at the enforceabilitylegal risk here whilst information prepayment risk for metals should come from london accessing any relevent inofrmation from ny may be helpful will call later 
see attached memo regarding my visit to the mg st louis office

this is the response i put together for louise this may be better done in person if so give me a call when you have time here is my vision of the two worlds enron and commodity logic there are two basic alternatives if you see commodity logic as an independent venture then we should build in independence in our communication of deal data the transaction store does this beths drivetrain project being led by john simmons will provide this in this model not every functionsystem currently performed will be supplanted by a commodity logic module complete reliance on commodity logic to provide deal data needed for these systems would certainly complicate the integration as commodity logic may reside outside the firewall the systemsfunctions we dont think well outsource to commodity logic are trade capture contracts valuation credit and sap functions additionally we would like to see the development of more reporting support for the dpr operations pricing model entelligence and sap warehouse data the implementation of a workflow issue tracking tool and an enron branded site for customer information this vision was arrived at by asking the question what would you never consider outsourcing either due to competitive advantage control issues or confidentiality i started shopping this vision around last week and will continue to do so this week to get feedback for finalization if the two are really one and will be managed as one going forward then certainly a single deal database could suffice in this case there should not be separately managed it functions as redundant development efforts may occur and we could focus the resources on the top priorities right now commodity logic is heavily dependent upon beths resources to provide the data from the legacy systems the work to do these data feeds competes with other priorities currently underway such as unify performance alberta open access for power etc i think it is important to note that we have two different requirements for deal data one to support commodity logic functions is transactional and near realtime in nature the second to support reporting functions is probably a batch end of day process the technical design of the two would be different to meet functional and performance requirements so in a combined world there would still probably be two sources of deal data one present on our network as separate messages for each deal that transactional systems build a listener to subscribe to and a second source in a warehouse for reporting either alternative can be approached however organizational alignment and priorities might be different further if the intent is to break commodity logic off into a separate entity then the first alternative is preferred to maintain arms length independence another alternative is to consider operations and commodity logic as a combined entity that is separate from enron that offers systems and back office services to enron and other industry players i think this may be what sally is envisioning if this is where we are headed then some of beths resources that are directly tied to support of operations systems should be combined with commodity logic resources so we can have a focus on coordinated priorities i believe this alternative has the same issues as the first in terms of what is outsourced eg becomes part of commodity logic and what remains proprietary and confidential to enron let me know your thoughts
as requested here is the log for today
sally i wondered if we needed to extend the special floor support schedule or if we needed to make it be an ongoing schedule of floor support please advise thanks zhiyong
as a follow up to the recent enron corp memorandum forming enron wholesale services ews effective today we have reorganized the wholesale services legal department the goals in reorganizing the department are as follows i align the legal department as closely as possible with the business units ii speed the flow of legal technology across the business units and iii achieve greater efficiency and consistency across the organization to this end a legal policy group will be formed for ews legal which will include lance schuler enron americas mark evans enron europe mark taylor enron net works alan aronowitz enron global markets julia murray enron industrial markets and bruce lundstrom enron global assets the organization chart for the ews legal department is attached more comprehensive organization charts will follow for each group mark frevert and mark haedicke

for you records attached is an organization chart
check out this website httpwwwthomsonesgcomindexhtm this is a company that confirmcorp is talking with regarding some type of relationship to improve confirmcorps financial viabilitystability either they will form some type of legal venture together or thomson execs may sit on the board of confirmcorp
forwarding per john sorrells request thanks
just a heads up a long winded email but please see highlighted paragraphs i find it hard to believe the scenario portrayed here but stranger things have happened will keep you posted
id like to get together as a group and discuss both commodity logic dcaf projects and see if we can put together a joint high level vision for supporting the trade clearing functions here are the items id like to initially discuss commodity logic deliverables timing and perhaps a demo or screen shots to show where we currently are in our development current dcaf requests and current areas of pain communicated from the user side legal credit concerns or issues known at this time once we have put together a strawman or high level plan then lets follow up with the larger user community and see if this address the highest priority concerns that were brought up at the deal clearing jad session cheryl please set up an hour and a half meeting with the people addressed under cc above to discuss the subject listed above id like to meet asap and would be willing to buy lunch if that aids us in getting this scheduled sooner than later
you might want to attend this meeting if you can we did some brainstorming today on what how a commodity logic payment module should be and came up with some options that are quite revolutionary it entails some risk but also has revenue potential as well we want to run it by both you and tom to see if this is a direction you want to head if youre not available then i can spend time with you to give you the overview
fyi
sally heres a link to the website httpgrodevcorpenroncom
fyi
this system was just implemented for ena etal as a global system we are working on convincing europe to incorporate into their envision plan there could be potential to include this in the commodity logic family as a way to aggregate and serve time series price information to users a direct competitor of this product would be fame energy which i looked at earlier this week on the surface it would appear our system is more robust than the one offered by fame
since this was a fix to a doorstep finding how do we react
scott with all our reporting changing to london office and now it appears some restructure of risk and the broadening of sallys role what are we going to do for the second report for our new risk manager justin den hertog he has taken over from alan he reports to me locally but functionally he would traditionally have reported to you on behalf of sallys area i assume this has now moved with the rest of us and would therefore be either james new or mike jordan in london can you please advise me via return email as we are working on our pep stuff reviews etc with thanks heidi
as per our discussion keith clarks offer letter incorrectly classified keith as a specialist when he should have been brought in as a sr specialist please correct our records accordingly thank you sheri thomas

dear sally we have been preparing this information daily until the end of the year either nancy or i will send it to you the full blown exception reporting will start the first week of january including elevation of issues so you wont get it every day anymore when christy starts i also have a contractor currently developing an access database to capture all exception reporting info for the past few days i have been hoping to spend time following up on the issues not only in the deal capture arena but in all reporting once the markets calm down ill be able to do so best regards shona

please read the following message from kathie grabstald and michelle vitrella in public relations the weekly electronic newsletter is a project that mark frevert requested and it is important that enron global markets be responsive when we are asked for information from our business units please pass along to kathie and michelle the name of a contact person in your group that will be responsible for providing updates for the weekly newsletter kathie has assured me that the person providing the information is not required to do the actual writing but provide bullet points which she will then prepare in paragraph form michelle will send a reminder message to the contact person when the updates are needed thank you for your assistance with this project
sally fyi having never worked with whalley before i may never hear back from him wed like to obtain documentation signed by skillingbuy authorizing the top traders for specific commodity groups lavoratosherriffshankman then well get those top traders to designate head traders and so on down the line if you have any insight as to the commodity group assignments listed below please let me know and since you probably see whalley often perhaps you could mention it i think shonas group wants to reclassify the dpr accordingly but theyre not certain on some of these either thank you cassandra
please note that the ets representative is dave mcellin sorry for the error
sally plse see the attached summary that risk ops prepares for frevertsherriffbrown on enron europe every week do your business unit controllers prepare something like this for the americas egm eim that we could use in our weekly briefing to rick buy whats happening is we try to prepare our own analysis of the trading pl and it really doesnt make much sense to do that since ops is probably already doing it id love to get looped in to similar analyses for the other business units also do you know who id contact in ees ill call barry pearce for ebs thank you cassandra

shona thanks for your task force summary below is what i have already produced here from the london perspective should we not be looking to get more detail of exactly the reasons were especially for human errors and highlight those areas where the problems arise rather than grouping things together and in so doing losing the detail also we should try to get some trend information so that it is clear where we are improving or not as the case may be on both a general and specific book basis james
attached for your review are the fundamental operating standards and controls that have been developed by the wholesale services group these standards are to be met by all enron offices and by each functional group within the operations process qualitative standards should be viewed as the basic measures to be taken when opening a new office or trading a new commodity statistics measuring compliance with quantitative standards will be monitored on a daily basis and any issues that arise will be addressed immediately as business unit heads you play a critical role in working with operations to ensure that proper controls are in place and working effectively please review this document and let me know if you have any questions or wish to discuss further regards brent

we have figured out why the credit group is getting so many new counterparty names in gas the spreadsheets that they are getting that information from are for position purposes only on pipe optons the value is captured in tagg and therefore if both had the correct counterparty it would be doublecounting credit risk the spreadsheet download has a specific download that it has to follow which includes counterparty name which in this case had to be put in as new counterparty i am working with debbie to figure out how we can download those positions without showing a counterparty at all from the spreadsheet it will be done as quickly as possible thanks
call we talk about this some time soon thanks bob ill have heather set up a short meeting
debbie is putting together a list of spreadsheets that these deals are coming from in the meantime we will start combing through some of the spreadsheets that we have thanks

jeff the we only have a few files in oerms which we will move to another directory sorry we could not have been more of a help scott
dear cassandra thanks for the message i believe it if fully understood by us and the individual risk management groups that explanations must be validated by the traders are you in addition saying that your group who has been very helpful in the past will no longer help us understand the cause of violationsnotifications to me this appears contrary to a team spirit attitude and not reflective of what you and i and vlady and i had discussed earlier today also we are working toward getting the memos out earlier and this is a real set back to that process thoughts to shona wilsonnaenronenron michael beniencorpenronenron chris abelhouectect daniel falconecorpenronenron cc veronica valdezhouectect sally beckhouectect subject limit violations and notifications process shona to share with the others our telephone discussion the notification template was not my request it was requested directly by skilling i know your group is working hard to meet mangagement expectations and in accordance with your request below market risk is happy to help you transition into this revised reporting format by reviewing the template prior to your distribution until you are comfortable with the reporting requirements the new pl notification limits and limit changes that will be in effect next tuesday should dramatically decrease the number of notifications so that should help it probably makes sense to re distribute the policy to your business unit controllers and the traders so they understand the policy requirements another issue that we discussed yesterday is the source of the violation explanations these should be provided to you by the head trader of that commodity group under the policy that commodity group manager is responsible for compliance with the risk management policy for the commodities under his responsibility along with the head of the energy ops for that commodity group if the traders are not providing these explanations to you or to your counterparts ops desk head business unit controller ill be happy to send them an e mail explaining their compliance obligation under the policy why dont you talk to each of the business unit controllers consider whether a process is already in place for this feedback as i understand it is for global products for example and if youd like me to send an e mail to whoever youre having difficulty with i will just let me know who our market risk desk heads will be happy to review their explanations but the problem is they can see whether theyre short or long and how the market moved in comparison but its the trader that can and should explain why they took a position whether theyre adjusting it based on the market moves etc let me know what else i can do to help streamline the process regards cassandra
shona to share with the others our telephone discussion the notification template was not my request it was requested directly by skilling i know your group is working hard to meet mangagement expectations and in accordance with your request below market risk is happy to help you transition into this revised reporting format by reviewing the template prior to your distribution until you are comfortable with the reporting requirements the new pl notification limits and limit changes that will be in effect next tuesday should dramatically decrease the number of notifications so that should help it probably makes sense to re distribute the policy to your business unit controllers and the traders so they understand the policy requirements another issue that we discussed yesterday is the source of the violation explanations these should be provided to you by the head trader of that commodity group under the policy that commodity group manager is responsible for compliance with the risk management policy for the commodities under his responsibility along with the head of the energy ops for that commodity group if the traders are not providing these explanations to you or to your counterparts ops desk head business unit controller ill be happy to send them an e mail explaining their compliance obligation under the policy why dont you talk to each of the business unit controllers consider whether a process is already in place for this feedback as i understand it is for global products for example and if youd like me to send an e mail to whoever youre having difficulty with i will just let me know who our market risk desk heads will be happy to review their explanations but the problem is they can see whether theyre short or long and how the market moved in comparison but its the trader that can and should explain why they took a position whether theyre adjusting it based on the market moves etc let me know what else i can do to help streamline the process regards cassandra

i have asked enas compensation team within hr to conduct a compensation study for me for all positions from manager level through vice president this analysis will include employees who are dedicated to ena eim and egm it had been the plan to complete our compensation analysis by focusing on the manager level and above following the market analysis for senior specialists and below that was completed by yvonne land i learned recently that yvonne has left the company and that she had not begun the analysis for managers and above todd burke who recently joined enron will be conducting the market survey and compensation analysis i met with todd recently he has had wonderful experience with towers perin and watson wyatt and i feel that we are fortunate to have him devoted to this project please give sufficient thought and attention to requests from todd the quality and timeliness of your responses will directly impact the quality and timeliness of the analysis that i will receive from todd i think that you should each have a vested interest in the success of this project todd also plans to resurvey market information for senior specialists and below so that his view of compensation will be complete and timely for all of energy operations since we recently took action on compensation levels for key players at the senior specialist level and below i would not anticipate further adjustments for those levels as a result of todds review you should receive a message from todd in the next day or so in which he will detail steps in the compensation analysis and what your role will be sally

as you may well know we are being pushed by arthur andersen to bring our prudency policy in line with that of north america in response to these pressures we have conducted a thorough review of our prudency policy and have determined that all discretionary prudency and general reserves including var based prudency should be eliminated deal specific prudency will however remain in order to avoid any arguments with aa near the quarter end the release to the london summary dpr should happen today for the august month end apologies for the short notice but the final decision was only made very recently please pass this message around to those people in your groups who are not on the above mail list so that everyone is aware of the change if there are any questions please let me know james
wes as we discussed on friday i think that there is merit to your arguments regarding the release in prudency in north america however this may alter the way we articulate the relative liquidity of our positions to banks and ratings agencies de facto we will be saying that our balance sheet and income statement reflect an ability to liquidate gas and power in north america at the mid with no adverse effects while this may be true typically these types of institutions see the result of liquidating much more liquid portfolios ie they will not believe that we have perfect liquidity i believe that we can satisfy both accounting and credit considerations if we maintain an ability to calculate an orderly liquidation under a negative pricing scenario basically multiple horizon var against a liquidating position this is what we showed moodys last month the main difference is that the resulting number will be a hit to pl as opposed to having reserves against it this is a long way of saying that i think it would be a good idea to discuss prudency methodology with both rac and treasury once you have finalized a course of action ted
sorry i left you off the original list thanks wanda
andy thanks for the update and your help in articulating this issue to the commercial team ted
per teds request i am forwarding you a copy of the most recent board approved risk management policy thanks veronica
attached below is a compilation of operational and information technology issues that effect the timeliness effectiveness and accuracy of the market risk management daily analysis daily we aggregate information regarding the origin of these issues to better diagnose where time money and resources should be allocated to improve information flow please call me if you have any questions regarding this document
shona to share with the others our telephone discussion the notification template was not my request it was requested directly by skilling i know your group is working hard to meet mangagement expectations and in accordance with your request below market risk is happy to help you transition into this revised reporting format by reviewing the template prior to your distribution until you are comfortable with the reporting requirements the new pl notification limits and limit changes that will be in effect next tuesday should dramatically decrease the number of notifications so that should help it probably makes sense to re distribute the policy to your business unit controllers and the traders so they understand the policy requirements another issue that we discussed yesterday is the source of the violation explanations these should be provided to you by the head trader of that commodity group under the policy that commodity group manager is responsible for compliance with the risk management policy for the commodities under his responsibility along with the head of the energy ops for that commodity group if the traders are not providing these explanations to you or to your counterparts ops desk head business unit controller ill be happy to send them an e mail explaining their compliance obligation under the policy why dont you talk to each of the business unit controllers consider whether a process is already in place for this feedback as i understand it is for global products for example and if youd like me to send an e mail to whoever youre having difficulty with i will just let me know who our market risk desk heads will be happy to review their explanations but the problem is they can see whether theyre short or long and how the market moved in comparison but its the trader that can and should explain why they took a position whether theyre adjusting it based on the market moves etc let me know what else i can do to help streamline the process regards cassandra
im not sure how or if youre planning on distributing to the business unit controllers or other ops people the updated risk management policy but im attaching a version without the limit amounts as this is what we use to distribute to people outside our group of course we tell traders their own specific limits and the top guys can see the consolidated dpr but for everyone else we provide it without limits i did send it to wanda curry and barry pearce but im not sending it to anyone in your org chart unless youd like me to id like to get this out on the rac website but since its a work in progress i think it might be a while regards cassandra
sally we didnt really cover the role you intended to play with ees and ebs as far as doorstep is concerned when we met with causeybuy or i just cant remember may we include ees and ebs in the scope of our one doorstep project and continue to work with shona also coordinating with wanda and barry when ees and ebs are involved things like the event below might make us re consider our need to visit origination offices i dont think this office was on any of our lists cassandra
sally i tried to get on your calendar but you are busy this week so i decide to send you a very important e mail you told me to contact you if i was ever considering leaving my current job so i am doing so at this time i want to say that i have thoroughly enjoyed working with you and you are the most impressive employee at enron at any level i feel comfortable speaking with you and appreciate all of your advice i am not totally unhappy with the recruiting part of my job i just feel that i do not buy into everything that is happening in my group there are many necessary changes that are needed and i feel that the program is heading in an excellent direction i just want to get into more of a sales oriented part of enron because i feel that my strength is selling i would like to at least get an interview with enron broadband because i know that they are filling up there retail sales groups although i do not have all the technical experience i know people who have gone over there with no technical or no sales experience as you know it is who you know and i do not have a relationship with david cox or any of the retail folks in broadband i was hoping that you would give david a call and see if he could at least give me an interview in one of the retail groups brent has called over to david and i feel if you were to call also it would help sally let me know if this will be ok and i would like to get on your calendar to discuss further nobody in my group knows that i am looking for another job so please keep this confidential i can not tell how much i value your opinion and advice in matters especially like these thank you so much and i look forward to hearing from you soon george hope

sally over the past year or so enron has made a great impact at the university of oklahoma in a very short time we have become one of the employers of of choice within the college of business we have been able to do this by paying attention to details and going beyond the necessary we have formed great relationships and planted seeds that will reap benefits for years to come if we do not become complacent i for one am an example of the impression that enron has forged at ou i am here because i believe that enron represents one of the greatest opportunities in not only the energy industry but the but the business world in general i am sending this note because i believe we are taking steps that will lessen our momentum at the university of oklahoma i have learned that we will not be sponsoring any entertainment for our presentation this fall as you know last year we sponsored a hypnotist and a drama team for entertainment after our presentations being a student at the time i felt this was a great idea and i know that my fellow students enjoyed the presentations as well they felt that it was a great opportunity to gain insight from enron representatives as well enjoy the entertainment which we provided as i understand the aa program now takes the position that this does not provide any residual value for enron and does not warrant the expense i do not understand this reasoning and feel that there is great value in such an arrangement it places another selling point on our presentation and gives us a better opportunity to familiarize ourselves with upcoming talent this may seem like an insignificant detail but i hope we will see the value that this opportunity presents the students of the em program and the jc penney leadership program are expecting another exciting evening from enron and hate to see us fall short of these expectations it is very likely that if we do not sponsor this event one of our competitors will the competition for talent is growing and we can not allow ourselves to become overconfident in our recruiting efforts enron is a great place to work and we must take that image to campus i know that mr mcconnell is a very exciting speaker and will no doubt amaze those present that is why we should take this simple step to have as many potential leaders present as possible and continue our path to recruiting dominance at the university of oklahoma i am fully aware that you were the instrumental element in putting ou within enrons sights your involvement at ou is greatly appreciated and i hope you maintain your interest in the university of oklahoma please consider my views on this matter and express any concerns of your own to the analyst and associate program thank you jody crook

sally this morning i spent some time with david maxwell of the merchant asset group i am very intrigued by the work the group does knowing that todd hall has moved on to egm and that the merchant asset group is in transition to report to shona wilson i have a recommendation i would like for the merchant asset group to report to me although i do not know all the methodologies used by the group i am familiar with the valuation of assets and understand the underlying principals for most methods at fleming i was involved at a much smaller scale in the reporting of similar portfolios and believe that i can be of assistance to the group in moving away from their current spread sheet environment also i enjoyed talking with david maxwell and understand what he is up against i believe he and i would work really well together let me know what you think thanks james

patti i left cindy a message last week about attending the ncl convention later in april she says that ken and jeff encourage board membership in community activities and that taking time during the business week is part of that so according to cindy the days at convention will not be counted as vacation days i guess i would view this as if i were in la on business so no notation on time out of the office thanks

this is a copy of the presentation that bob superty made to the peoples energy board this week lousie kitchen told me that he was very impressive in the presentation not a surprise to me but it is nice when others recognize the talent that is in the operations organization we may be able to incorporate some of this into our presentation to originators for internal purposes and there may be parts of this that could be used in external marketing tools sally
please print in color for me thanks

fyi lets discuss sally
tight time frame for mike co on metals deliverables raises the question around the timing of next weeks visit on metal will we divert critical resources from these efforts sally
it didnt occur to me until seeing richards message that we might have a hole in communications with mary being out on an extended basis we should probably create a message on marys phone that refers callers to someone else ditto on email messages beth does it make sense for that referral to be james or you or vanessa others within our organization that may try to reach mary could have questions about global databases projects that joels group had been handling etc i am not trying to put this off on you if you dont think it is appropriate but james andor vanessa came to mind as possible contacts by copy to hector i also wonder if we should review incoming emails that have come to mary over the last several weeks to see if there are some internal requests to which we need to respond let me know what you think sally
does vanessa know anything about this i know that we had a definite interest several years ago in a system from siebel we shelved it at the time due to it resource constraints and philippes concern over costs in the meantime ees bought a license and uses this system i know that mary was resurrecting this with someone on her team she had recently reviewed it with brenda herod i believe this is one of the items that we listed in dallas as a need if we were to get heavily into providing services for others sally
please ask sheri thomas if this person needs access to eol applications i dont recognize the names the name noted as manager is loyd will who is a commercial employee reporting to kevin presto thanks

fyi see attachment for latest attempt at satisfying the ill defined if this is not on target we will keep working until it is sally
all eight students that we interviewed for the enron scholarship were great and we should actively be sure that we get them on our interview schedules next year when they are in the second year of the mba program i dont want to simply leave that to chance by encouraging them to consider us karens letter noted below is a good idea but we should augment that by getting these students names on our radar screen for next year i will find out who the recruiter is for ut mbas and i will get copies of the students resumes and my notes on where they could be a good fit to that recruiter sally

i left you a couple of messages with two different assistants today for you to call am sure that it is a busy monday i will send this note so that i dont forget the purpose with savita assuming the role previously play ed by sheri with regard to the product control group i wanted to underscor e the importance of a free flow of information between the eol team and my operations team one of the roles that sheris team fulfilled was keeping my risk and operations teams apprised of any changes within eol that can ha ve an impact on bridging to our legacy systems i may have met savita once in passing i checked with jeff gossett and stacey white risk leads over gas and power respectively and neither one has heard of or met savita although jennifer denney will play an active role i know that she will be out on maternity leave soon so it is important for savita to know the righ t players on the operations team and for them to know her i will contact savita directly to make the appropriate introductions i just wanted your support and encouragement for savita in making the right connections within operations sally

the list of proposed netco employees that amy fitzpatrick provided to me at your request included tabs for weather and crude do you contemplate that netco would trade those commoditiesproducts bob halls team that he has assembled for netco does not include anyone with either weather or crude operations experience we retained two top notch operations individuals todd hall and kevin sweeney who at this time are not on the list for netco both have extensive risk management experience and both have also managed all aspects of trading operations documentation risk books and settlements todd and kevin each are good managers and they are working managers who know how to execute the details todd has most recently been in charge of all aspects of operations for weather prior to has role in egm todd created the mpr and supported all daily activities around valuing the assets in that portfolio he also has had extensive experience in gas risk management sweeneys most recent assignment has been to manage operations for eim the bulk of his enron experience has been in crude and crude products he was part of the original team that opened the singapore trading office and has experience in the uk as well if you anticipate dealing in commodities outside gas and power todd and kevin would both be great players to have on the netco team lets discuss sally

memo on floor meetings plus my reply to greg and philippe
please print for me black white okay i cant seemt to get this printed from my printer thanks
did debbie talk with the two of you before putting together her memo is she raising this to me because she wasnt comfortable with the outcome of her conversations with you two or did she skip that step just curious before i send any type of response i would need details from you around the process for updates to entelligence and global counterparty surely one feeds the other sally
i hope that each one of you will arrange your schedules tomorrow to make the time to vote also please encourage everyone on your staff to take the time to vote tomorrow for those employees who typically work later hours please suggest that they take the time to vote before coming to the office everyone should feel that they have sufficient time to make their vote count it should be interesting to watch the returns tomorrow evening hopefully we will have all played a part in the outcome
this one is pretty funny
congratulations on the birth of your daughter meagan called this afternoon to tell me the news i will perhaps get more details when i get home tonight i hope that laura and the baby are doing well let us know what we can do to help i am sure that jackson is a proud brother we will be anxious to meet our newest neighbor sally
i just composed a somewhat lengthy email about the anniversary trip and then closed out lotus notes and checked discard changes so it is gone but not sent can you email me back your office phone number and if it is convenient for you i will give you call and use old fashioned technology
i know that you left a message with patti about contacting david eastlake i have sent email messages to him that must have been delivered as i did not get a message about undeliverable email i havent heard back from him the phone numbers on the contact sheet are the students numbers at school i have left a voice mail both for daniel jenkins and david during the week between christmas and new years knowing that it was unlikely that they would be in austin it would be great to have their home numbers as better contact numbers during school breaks i was on vacation the week before christmas and for two days last week and i admit that i did not contact any students while i was on vacation i will try their austin numbers this week again although classes dont start until next week they may come back to austin early similar situation with my ou students i have conversed by email since i did not have home numbers do you know when classes resume at ou i will try my students there this week again by phone in case they are returning to school early i had lunch with ted jacobs the week between christmas and new years it was a thank you for finding some orange bowl tickets that david and i purchased yes we were at the game and saw ou win the national championship i have an update from him on our list of ou candidates according to his understanding of some of the decisions they have made if you have a few minutes today give me a call and i can go over that with you since full time offers were changed did we appropriately change summer intern offers as well i didnt see anything in your emails about that let me know sally
sheri has told me that you made an announcement recently congratulations on the baby i hope that you are feeling well i am so happy for you and your husband my how your lives will change but how enriched they will be our three are so much fun i will also always be honest with expectant moms and say that a new baby is an incredible amount of work as well and that it sometimes takes a while to really enjoy the experience if you ever want some funny stories about adjusting to being a first time mom just let me know i would be glad to share my experience with you sally
i have completed internal feedback forms through the pep system for brent price bob hall and peggy hedstrom those appeared to be the only names that you included for which you wanted my input somehow from andreas voice mail message last week i had anticipated responding to more requests i thought perhaps input in working with wes within ena or melissa on sap those werent on my list within the pep system so i just wanted you to know that i have responded to the three that were there if there was intent for me to respond to any others they werent accessible in the system believe me i am not asking for more just wanted to be sure that what i saw in pep as a request matched your expectations in terms of my response sally
i saw kims response to stephen douglas but it left me short of comfort on a completion timeline or enough details around assurance on an on going basis that this will be kept up i sent the note below to kim i am sure that she manages well but i think that we should encourage her to step into full responsibility and to be able to effectively communicate that within the organization it is likely that when stephen reads her note that he will call me and tell me that he still doesnt know when this task will be completed that was his concern yesterday and kims note really doesnt address that if she doesnt have an estimated completion date then she should set a target date for having all of the info compiled and state that at that date she will be able to create a realistic timeline for completing the task kim must own and communicate effectively the solutions or i will be the one that gets the phone calls the ena organization must develop confidence in others on our team lets help kim earn that confidence by coaching her to imagine the info that the customers needs stephen and to clearly communicate information that addresses his needs thanks
to continue to keep you in the loop looks like mike is moving in the right direction on this sally
you should see this reply from mike it is more positive than the response from james new sounds as if they have not yet finished their document on required changes to processes systems commercial practices etc to move to a same day calculation of their books mike and i have talked about this as a longer term goal for the london office and i knew that he was working with james and others to come up with a plan and a timeline i expect to review that with mike when he has it in a draft form that warrants that discussion that is why you havent yet seen the document sally
i should have included you on this contact list i will remember to do so next time i will be in the office all of this week so please call me directly on any information needs you or team may have this week
we are making some progress with the timeliness of london information more to come
please print this for me in color asap i need to review it today and get back to louise thanks
got your most recent message your observation is correct that the enron americas staff member on shawns team has not been involved to date with doorstep reviews or planning although shawn made an offer to michelle some time ago there was a long lead time for her arrival she did not start with the company until after thanksgiving since she started a couple of weeks ago wes and i have asked her to look into several specific findings from the most aa internal audit projects and to work with our staffs to provide some solutions to issues that were raised there simply has not been the time to date to expose her to doorstep after shawn and i meet see below i will briefly summarize for you the roles that all groups will play in the doorstep review process before we move forward i want to be sure that all parties agree on the purpose methodology participants and execution plan for this on going project

fyi would love to have your comments or suggestions

hope your long weekend was a good one uneventful on monday at least got your message last friday it seems as if kristin is more and more interested in the ebs role especially after her continuing discussions with jim fallon the timing of her trip to london is somewhat up in the air may be the end of this week may be next week i think it will still be good for you and kristin to talk in person kristin and todd are both very qualified and you would love working with both kristins established working relationship with jim fallon would definitely be a plus i dont want to lose both of them from ena however at the same time so i would suggest that we make it an either or propostion i got your message on housinglocation in houston i am headed out of the office soon for an offsite meeting hosted by enas office of the chairman i will call you on friday when i am back in the office and talk through some options on housing
approved sally
did you get to check on lunch plans for thursday or friday next week with directs this looks like it could conflict
i scheduled this meeting in houston to best accomodate schedules of some of our enron speakers the hill country or even galveston was going to make it impossible for jeff skilling to join us i would look at this meeting as if it were to be held outside of town i have preliminarily reserved rooms for all of you at the wyndham warwick part of the reason for this forum is to meet and get to know your counterparts in other enron operating companies and from around the world if you can stay at the hotel this team building will probably be enhanced this memo is not to force you to pack your bags and stay at the hotel but to let you know that my budget for the event did include rooms for all of you for sunday and monday nights i hate the sunday thing but in trying to minimize the time out of the office for those who will travel from far away this best suited their schedules please let patti know on thursday whether or not you would like a room at the hotel to make it easier for you to fully participate
i am forwarding a message from a wellesley student which includes her resume lets make sure that she is on our interview schedule for our return visit in november i talked with her quite a bit before the presentation and was impressed with her she has followed up with phone calls and this email i am sending her some additional information on enron at her request to help familiarize her with the company her work experience to date has been with more traditional energy companies sally
i did find one that i have not used you will just need to change the information at the top of the page
attached is your actual form i did not have a totally blank one to forward as i have actually done work on all evals on my disk so i am sending yours so that you can erase your data and use this as a template hope this works
hector has still referred to the key players under jeff gossett as managers however only one of these will kelly is a manager the remainder are senior specialists let me know if you would like to discuss any of this in detail we are potentially exposed for steve jackson to hire some of these players away steve is going to have deliverables at his new employer our competitor which will require that he have good people he will be moving to columbus ohio where he will not personally know anyone locally to hire he does know these risk specialists here and being young and single or childless their mobility factors could be high enron would not want to lose any other talent to steves new employer
hector the key employees that jeff has identified are senior specialists with the exception of will kelly if you remember these are the risk employees that i was concerned about when steve jackson tendered his letter of resignation steve will be taking a similar role with a competitor and it is not inconceivable that he might approach some enron employees to join him and help ensure his success with his new employer we dont want this to happen waiting until the end of november to implement an effective retention plan does not make sense please call me tomorrow and lets talk about how we can jump start this thanks sally
please keep this for reference as we create a holiday contact list thanks
i always compile a contact list for energy operations during the holidays thanksgiving christmas and new years just let me know who appropriate contacts will be especially for the dpr and mpr during the dates that you are out sounds as if you should see a white christmas sally
i had lunch with barry yesterday and suggested that they might benefit from attending these meetings hope you dont mind my extending that invitation sally
it is with regret that i have accepted steve jacksons letter of resignation from enron steve has made a choice to leave enron and to join another company in the industry i know that you will join me in thanking him for his many years of service to enron and the contributions that he has made his risk expertise and his knowledge of ena transactions will be missed as will his leadership on the gas team although steves official last day with the company is in two weeks today is his last day in the office he will be available by phone over the next two weeks if there are questions that you may have on any open items that you were covering with steve patti has his home number if you need that we will also plan a happy hour for steve and we will let you know when and where that will take place effective tomorrow jeff gossett will assume leadership of the gas risk group reporting to me jeff will join bob hall and leslie reeves as business controllers for natural gas to continue to work together to provide leadership for the processes controls people and systems that support all aspects of this key business for north america please join me in congratulating jeff on his new responsibilities
fyii will keep you posted
fyi
this memo apparently was already out on email when we were meeting in my office regarding confirmations the language regarding jeffs role on financial confirmations and settlements was left in the memo it wasnt clear to me when we met whether scott and leslie had talked while looking at a draft of the memo or whether she had seen this on email since you said that you had not seen this memo please follow up with scott leslie and jeff to ensure a common understanding around financial confirmations and settlements so that can be communicated within the organization there should not be confusion over who has responsibility for financial confirms and settlements this memo as sent will create that confusion thanks
is this a timeline for all of ena or just for the accounting group
this request is approved your request forms that you send still dont provide enough information in laymans terms so that i know what you are asking to be approved are we working on this

this employee and his supervisor bob schorr do not report in to me someone else should be approving this requested access
it was good to see you in norman earlier this week as always i appreciated your attendance at the presentation and at coachs afterwards i am sure that it is rewarding for you to see former students such as jody and nate participating on the other side of the recruiting table you have done a great job in changing and promoting the program i am pushing lexi to resolve the question around interview dates for summer interns asap i have also left mike mcconnell a message to make him aware of the issue i should be able to get back with you next week hopefully with a change in our strategy if you do become aware of five ou texas tickets please let me know we will certainly purchase them i just made the assumption that all tickets may already be sold on another note david has worn his ou shirt to work and has gotten lots of compliments he has a number of people that have asked him about school shirts caps etc do you have a list of the schools that you can get merchandise for and the types of merchandise that you can get let me know we can probably place a few orders through you

this employee and hisher manager bob schorr do not report in to me this approval should be sent to someone else
too late with your spreadsheet the instructions that we got from donna were that i should review the resumes pass them to brent for his review and then on to causey for his review considering our schedules and the large number of resumes to review that would have been an impossible task to complete by thursday at noon i received the resumes after lunch on tuesday just before leaving for the airport to catch the plane for oklahoma i asked patti to make a copy of the packet for brent and i knew that rick would not want to take the time to review the resumes without some organization and screening first i reviewed as many of the resumes as i could on the plane on the way back to houston today all of the liberal arts resumes and about one third of the business resumes and brent reviewed them last night after his training class we got those to rick today by noon as he was leaving the office i believe that rick will review what brent and i put together and then will pass the resumes along to you since you only emailed your spreadsheet this morning after brent and i had done our reviews you will have to cross reference the info on the spreadsheet with the selected resumes brent and i would have appreciated some organization and screening of the resumes as well i would suggest that in the future that your team should make copies of the resumes for everyone that you would like to have doing the review the plan of passing them from one person to another is not practical and i should not have had to make the copies for brent if you are going to ask vps and mds to help in this process in a very short time frame then i would suggest that you use their time wisely if someone from you team had organized the resumes into three groups by gpas or majors that would have given us a good starting point instead of a jumble of resumes two page resumes were not stapled together and there were a number of resumes of mbas included which should be considered for associates interviews not analysts interviews please give us organized information to react to not simply a jumble of data that we have to weed through all of us want to participate and to be as involved as possible in the recruiting process but we need to be able to rely on the program for some basic administrative and organizational work i send these suggestions with the intent of constantly bettering the program and with the intent of helping you to succeed in your role not being critical i hope that you will take these suggestions in that light brent and i and i am sure hunter too would have appreciated
this approval request is incomplete it does not include the name of this employees manager i do not know the employee and without the name of the manager i cant possibly approve this please get someone to complete this request
i am not trying to twist any arms with this question but is there anything we can do so that jody can make the presentation at ou since he was the top graduate from the energy management program at ou it would be great for him to be at the presentation next tuesday night i know that recruiting events can be a drain on staffing but it is also time well spent i do know that jody is in a role that has real day to day commitments so if there is not a feasible way to have someone calc a book for him i will understand i just wanted you to take a look at this thanks
i have asked enas compensation team within hr to conduct a compensation study for me for all positions from manager level through vice president this analysis will include employees who are dedicated to ena eim and egm it had been the plan to complete our compensation analysis by focusing on the manager level and above following the market analysis for senior specialists and below that was completed by yvonne land i learned recently that yvonne has left the company and that she had not begun the analysis for managers and above todd burke who recently joined enron will be conducting the market survey and compensation analysis i met with todd recently he has had wonderful experience with towers perin and watson wyatt and i feel that we are fortunate to have him devoted to this project please give sufficient thought and attention to requests from todd the quality and timeliness of your responses will directly impact the quality and timeliness of the analysis that i will receive from todd i think that you should each have a vested interest in the success of this project todd also plans to resurvey market information for senior specialists and below so that his view of compensation will be complete and timely for all of energy operations since we recently took action on compensation levels for key players at the senior specialist level and below i would not anticipate further adjustments for those levels as a result of todds review you should receive a message from todd in the next day or so in which he will detail steps in the compensation analysis and what your role will be sally

i heard today that curtis smith has resigned i am sure that both ot you know that curtis and jeremy wong were viewed by users as critical resources for erms support even at a stand still my team had great concern over the rumored loss of curtis andor jeremy and with the assumption that sitara will not go forward for valuation then erms really has become repositioned as one of our key strategic systems there is much to do to catch up if you will with changes and enhancements that were put on hold for several years during the sitara development stage and our business continues to grow and change rapidly requiring responsive enhancements on an on going basis i would like to get together to discuss the staffing plan for support of erms as soon as possible we need to understand how day to day production support will be managed and how development work will be effectively handled i will ask my assistant to set up a meeting as soon as possible
im trying again
i think that we sent this to the wrong email address at first
i thought that you might want to know that randy gays wife passed away on friday evening randy is the manager of the west desk gas logistics group his wife had been on a liver transplant list for some time and had been moved up on the list several weeks ago as her condition became more severe unfortunately she developed complications during the last two weeks which resulted in her being removed from the transplant list randy has a four year old daughter several of us will be attending the funeral today over the past several weeks within ena we have raised funds for playground equipment to complete a fund raising effort that randys wife had headed for their civic association through donations from ena employees the original goal for the playground equipment was far exceeded
have you had a chance to talk with dave b on any of this it might be helpful for you to put a call in to tom martin today to give him your phone number and to let him know that you are working closely with dave and that you are available for any questions nothing may come up but i think that tom would feel better with this gesture probably wouldnt hurt to log the same call or email in to the rest of the guys on the list that will give all of them a feeling of continuity with regard to information from dave on this project do you have contact information for brenda if not i would get that from yvette convey her assistant she is making the rounds with patrick conner and the corporate development team doing site visits on two additional paper mills that we may purchase thanks sally

wow thanks for copying me on these sally
it is good to be getting feedback on these standards after you have received all responses i will be curious as to the number and nature of changes suggested i think for this to be powerful we will need to expect all commodities and all locations to meet common standards i will reserve judgement on that however pending your assessment once you have gotten all responses
no manager is listed below on this request and i dont know the employee the manager blank must be completed for me to be able to address these without that i cant possibly tell what group this person is working in and whether or not it makes sense to grant the system access please return this to me for my approval when complete

as we said before i would like to be able to utilize todd hall for special projects from time to time i had mentioned to mike jordan that once todd completed his commoditylogic role that i thought that we could take some of his time to follow up on continental power issues which could fit nicely with some work he could do on weather in europe i dont know about the one month timeframe i would prefer that todd review the initiatives and determine the best way to proceed it might mean a couple of weeks over there for starters and then a follow up shorter trip a few weeks later i dont think that todd is keen on any elongated stays in europe particularly without the family can we still use todd 
thanks for taking the time to give me your input on the analyst program it will help to have that info in my meeting on friday

to my surprise i was chosen today to sit on a jury to hear a felony charge the judge believes that we can conclude the trial by end of the day on wednesday or perhaps on thursday i will be back here working after trial hours in the office and checking voice mail messages during breaks in the proceedings i will be back full time as soon as my civic duty is fulfilled enron is well presented in the court system over the next few days i sat by mark koenig in the jury assembly room today and he too was chosen to serve on another jury
fyi i will be out of the office for the two meetings on wednesday this week i will be working in chicago monday and tuesday next week i will be back in the office on wednesday of next week todd tells me that a logo has been selected can you email that to me if not available electronically i will see it when i am back in the office next wednesday if no one has stepped in to a look at hours spent on the confirmation process and opportunities that may be presented there i will do that when i am back in the office next week my first move will be to sit down with jeff sorenson who leads the confirmation group to put some meat around the hours that james scribner sent you when we look at numbers of confirmations and compare several months of data we will be better able to identify which activities were stressed by increased business and which activities seemed to absorb increased business more easily i also think that jeff will be the best source of information about ideas on streamlining opportunities to simply life at enron and perhaps create value externally all of the advances made over the last several years auto confirm the decaf system auto faxing digitized signatures document scanning etc in our confirm group have been ideas generated by the business group and led by them for implementation no doubt jeff has some good ideas on where to go next
fyi
fyi my reply to peggy
how do we get the right focus on support for calgary mark taylor wanted to hold up transferring confirm responsibility to calgary so we still need to provide excellent service to them while i can appreciate that diane is out that should actually be a red flag to us to pay even closer attention to the calgary stuff every screw up looks big to them and they cant understand how mistakes continue to happen while i know that they cant appreciate the vast number of transactions that the group is currently handling we still need to be able to deliver top notch service unfortunately we stub our toe enough with calgary that they view of our operation is one that delivers pretty poor to average service that is a terrible internal pr issue lets put our heads together on not just the confirm issue but all of our dealings with calgary so that we quickly turn around our error rate andor their perceptions and can sustain excellent service i am copying susan because she has dealt recently with an issue brought to our attention by rob milnthorp president of enron canada she responded to rob quickly and handled things professionally so she may not have shared the details with you at the time but now we need to look at all of our outstanding potential or past issues with calgary and get a solution in place she can fill you in on the details in that situation susan do you have any ideas on how we can reshape our image with calgary
james i didnt see your name on the distribution for this so im forwarding it to you patti
rob let me know if you get feedback from aec that does not indicate that they are getting what they need susan and bryce are both very capable and responsive so i am confident that aecs questions can be resolved quickly sally

fyi this came as a surprise to me didnt know whether or not you knew about gingers departure sally
i have heard through the grapevine that you produce a weekly status report on the mg aquisition and assimilation would you please include me on that distribution list effective this week i believe that it is assumed that fernley dyson will have day to day responsibility for this business once the aquisition is completed however in my role over global risk management operations i find myself fielding questions regarding our assessment of operations and any issues surrounding assimilation brent price who reports to me and is on temporary assignment in the london office has been keeping me updated on progress to date his return soon to houston however will create a potential information gap that the weekly status report may help to fill thanks in advance to your attention to this
approved please process thanks sally beck
i meant to send this to you sally
i interviewed analystassociate candidates in the office on saturday as did four other directorssenior directors from energy operations i completed the evaluations of the four candidates that i interviewed and submitted those but was unable to stay for the decision meeting after lunch due to commitments to attend a funeral i talked with ted bland this morning and he suggested that i provide you with a list of candidates that could be a fit in energy operations analysts tara piazze potential fit in one of my risk management operations teams joseph piotrowski aa consulting background would be a good fit for my operations team focused on eol these are ena employees i need to add more strength to this group charles ames currently works in back office for a brokerage firm wants to trade would like to have him in risk to learn the business and enrons risk books we could immediately benefit from his background while he learns enron and how we manage risk then he could add even more value in moving to a trading role if appropriate better fits as direct hires not analyst or associate based on work experience and fit mike perun vp of small bank ted brought him in with my group in mind two of my directors interviewed him on saturday wed like to consider him as a direct hire jason sukenik undergrad and masters degrees in accounting plus mba could be good fit as direct hire in as managerdirector based on experience associates ryan ngo i believe that kevin presto suggested him for my group adele pickens shes on my list need to research interviewers comments who suggested my group for an assignment for her i dont think that anyone from energy operations interviewed him or her jennifer bagwell apparently remarked to two interviewers that she did not want to trade would like to see if there is a fit for her in managing risk or operations let me know about next steps in this process i would be glad to talk about any of this in more depth
i got the memo from naomi that you sent first who is doug imrie does he have a strong background in trading operations will he be able to coordinate effective reviews from a controls perspective and will he be able to be the front runner on how mg runs its business so that we will get a jump start on how best to assimilate the business i think that this effort should be much broader than deal testing it should encompass assessing people processes controls systems support etc to do this quickly and effectively will require persons who are knowledgeable about daily trading operations i dont know naomis background but i wonder if she will be the right person to lead one of these efforts since she does not work in operations on a daily basis patrick conner left me a message today to be certain that we are plugged in with an appropriate team from ena to review the chicago and new york offices from the sound of naomis memo it looks as if andy cornfield is assume to have the us responsibility again i dont know andy should we circle the wagons and develop a plan for doorstep reviews that includes some others in the process particularly those that have been involved in some doorstep reviews to date and those that have daily operational experience i have also mentioned shona as a good resource as well
scott earnest announced in the staff meeting today that in a meeting he had earlier today with jeff shankman and vince kaminiski that jeff announced that he had gotten the nod from mark frevert to manage the lng book of business this sentence structure is bad but you get the drift that is probably what shankman has alluded to in terms of increased responsibility i will assume that is in addition to gas but i dont know that for sure scott has been working on setting up the risk books for lng working closely over the last several weeks with vince kaminski we need to talk about this business and the best way to support it have you had any conversations with jeff on this
i didnt know that you were talking to jennifer i had put her on the list of attendees at last thursdays meeting with tom gros he had asked about someone being included that had been involved with enron online i felt that she might be perfect to be involved in networks with her exposure to eol i dont know whether or not you realized that she was in the room for that conference call what is she going to do for you in gas we may be hardpressed to find another strong candidate for the networks project who has been as involved with eol sally

barry sent me a copy of the draft memo announcing his role within ebs since scott pleus is currently in that role and does have people reporting to him in ebs that are in trading operations i would suggest that the memo contain a mention of the transition example scott pleus is currently director of trading operations for ebs he will be transitioning to an origination role within ebs in mid may as barry pearce assumes his responsibilities for ebs the current trading staff for ebs will report to barry effective with his start date in may i also heard from barry today that todd lindholm let him know that he is out of the picture with regard to commercial support for bandwidth trading operations and that barry will report to john echols so sounds as if that is clarified

kevin sweeney forwarded this message to me fernley may have made you aware of his decision with tani when you and he talked yesterday if not i thought that you might be interested in this sally

we are wrapping up several hours in the office and have tested all commodities front to back we found a few minor issues primarily reports with report dates that were incorrect the content and underlying calculations in the reports were correct these were really just query and formatting issues all were quick fixes of five minutes or less so at this point we feel confident about our system situation more will unfold with counterparties next week but hopefully all found this as uneventful as have we hope your new years celebration was fun we saw pictures of the london festivies on tv as we were cooking our new years eve dinner last night at home see you soon

back on the calendar this afternoon with andy zipper to get his comments on the presentation should be able to get you and john a copy following that meeting
according to tammy shepperd who is very involved in space allocation for the new building a location for sheri thomas product control group remains up in the air sheri andy zipper john cummings and surresh have met to discuss space and all agree that sheris group needs to be located with their groups my understanding is that you have designated a certain number of spaces for enw on the trading floors but that sheris group is not included in that count can we get together when you return to the office next week and discuss floor space thanks sally
patti i left cindy a message last week about attending the ncl convention later in april she says that ken and jeff encourage board membership in community activities and that taking time during the business week is part of that so according to cindy the days at convention will not be counted as vacation days i guess i would view this as if i were in la on business so no notation on time out of the office thanks
would you like to be included we will try to start this next week i will ask patti to get with you on the details sally
i was really looking for the list of attendees to see we wanted to share rides to neimans can you get that list form vanessa thanks

in a meeting with louise kitchen today she mentioned that bob superty was very impressive in a presentation that he made to the peoples energy board of directors on wednesday she was very complimentary i have let bob know about louises praise thought that you would like to know as well sally
this is a copy of the presentation that bob superty made to the peoples energy board this week lousie kitchen told me that he was very impressive in the presentation not a surprise to me but it is nice when others recognize the talent that is in the operations organization we may be able to incorporate some of this into our presentation to originators for internal purposes and there may be parts of this that could be used in external marketing tools sally
please print in color for me thanks
is this on vanessas update list are users happy with the results
please put this on my calendar i cant get this to print and it is too small for me to read
fyi lets discuss sally
tight time frame for mike co on metals deliverables raises the question around the timing of next weeks visit on metal will we divert critical resources from these efforts sally
it didnt occur to me until seeing richards message that we might have a hole in communications with mary being out on an extended basis we should probably create a message on marys phone that refers callers to someone else ditto on email messages beth does it make sense for that referral to be james or you or vanessa others within our organization that may try to reach mary could have questions about global databases projects that joels group had been handling etc i am not trying to put this off on you if you dont think it is appropriate but james andor vanessa came to mind as possible contacts by copy to hector i also wonder if we should review incoming emails that have come to mary over the last several weeks to see if there are some internal requests to which we need to respond let me know what you think sally
does vanessa know anything about this i know that we had a definite interest several years ago in a system from siebel we shelved it at the time due to it resource constraints and philippes concern over costs in the meantime ees bought a license and uses this system i know that mary was resurrecting this with someone on her team she had recently reviewed it with brenda herod i believe this is one of the items that we listed in dallas as a need if we were to get heavily into providing services for others sally
please ask sheri thomas if this person needs access to eol applications i dont recognize the names the name noted as manager is loyd will who is a commercial employee reporting to kevin presto thanks
please put these dates on my calendar and let lexi know that at this point the calendar is open and that i will be happy to participate in both the information session and the interviews thanks

fyi see attachment for latest attempt at satisfying the ill defined if this is not on target we will keep working until it is sally
all eight students that we interviewed for the enron scholarship were great and we should actively be sure that we get them on our interview schedules next year when they are in the second year of the mba program i dont want to simply leave that to chance by encouraging them to consider us karens letter noted below is a good idea but we should augment that by getting these students names on our radar screen for next year i will find out who the recruiter is for ut mbas and i will get copies of the students resumes and my notes on where they could be a good fit to that recruiter sally
i have tried but cannot get the attachment to open to look at the report produced by london do you have a hard copy that i can see i can get it from you during the risk forum luncheon today thanks

i didnt search this long list of addressees to see if you were included in case this is going only to peggy i thought that i would forward this since she is still on vacation sally
have you heard any more about this i didnt see it on my calendar this does conflict with philippes thursday staff meeting i believe maybe philippe will cancel that let me know thanks sally
fyi per my longer email update message
buried somewhere in these email messages is a resume please print for me and put it in a resume folder along with some others that i have in my outbox i will need to review them when i am back thanks
fyi beth apollo led the doorstep review in monterrey last week no problems discovered but beth did find some communications and system access issues that could be improved to make it easier for maxs team to do their jobs she has quickly identified a point person within operations in houston who is bi lingual gordon maxs note addresses his pleasure over beths responsiveness and the doorstep process in general just wanted to pass this along sally
thought you might like to see this note from max on the doorstep review in monterrey beth is a great addition and has made a very positive impact already sally
wes memo finally went out to sherriff dpr wont change at this point in time sally
please get with tina and work out how we will handle expense reimbursements for gregs approval if tina and greg are not yet using the online format then simply sending him original receipts probably wont do anything for him thanks sally
please print the attachment for me in color thanks sally
please keep this number handy just in case thanks
any feedback or interest please let me know sally
i have a stretch goal for the operations budget under enron americas to reduce costs by the end of the year to this end i have recently studied possible options for reaching the targeted savings to make the best decision on this i have reviewed functions within my team on the basis of core versus non core functions and the inherent cost versus value proposition as a result i made the decision last week to disband joel henenbergs team to fulfill the role of joel and his team in leading it initiatives we will lean on the appropriate it project managers and the business sponsorsend users joel and his team were told of this decision on friday afternoon last week our hr rep spent some time with the team explaining the corporate re deployment service that they all will be working through over the next few weeks let me know if you have any questions regarding this while it was a tough decision i feel comfortable having made it
as a result of the reorg announcement a couple of weeks ago this report should now go to philippe bibi or his assistant peggy mccurley louise is now in the office of the chair of enron americas philippe has assumed the role as chairman of enron net works since this report is a net works report please remove louise from the distribution list and add philippe and peggy effective immediately also i would like to review and perhaps edit the principal projectsdeals section each week before distribution what would be the most efficient way to get this done and into your hands in a timely way sally
thanks patti
this is the replacement meeting for the hot list meeting i have asked that you be included on the list of attendees sally
looks like a permanent cancellation to me at least for now we can work with wes on the best ways to stay abreast of developing deals that impact enron americas
email messages says to check website to determine whether or not dsl is available at my home however i dont see a spot on the website to check that information can you provide more details
just remember that the dpr is used as an accounting tool as well despite my constant reminders that it is a tool for reporting daily trading results and positions against board approved limits so do approach this as fact finding and then i would suggest reviewing any recommendations that you may have with wes colwell and the rac group before any changes are made looks like a good group i hope that all will attend and participate did pam do some due diligence for you before sending this email so that you know this date and time works for everyone keep me posted on progress sally
please change location of this meeting for this week only i would also change the notation for this recurring meeting to enw staff meeting with philippe with peggy mccurley as the contact thanks
please print attachment for me thanks
please change this on my calendar thanks
kathryn corbally senior director currently in investor relations is moving to connecticut soon to join her husband he has been working up there for the last six or eight months he was one of the group that defected from our weather derivatives team about a year ago she hopes to continue to work for enron has been talking with investor relations and some other groups that i cant remember and to do so either out of her home or in enrons new york office it struck me that depending upon needs at mgs new york office that kathryn could be someone for you to consider she came originally from the london office you may or may not find anyone still there that could give you some feedback on her in london she ran mid and back office that was in very early days for eel so most of the job was probably accounting she came to houston and has done a number of different things i think that she is well organized and control minded understands enrons business managing a group of people is probably not her strongest attribute i am not sure that people enjoy working under her that could be old news however there are a number of people here in houston that could probably give you a read on her based on very recent experience do you know of her just thought that i would mention her as a potential resource in new york dont know what your short and longer term needs are there she would definitely represent an enron point of view they have two small daughters she might be interested in something part time even could mean lower cost that way this idea may not have any merit or you may not have a need around metals if you do want to consider this i will be glad to help identify who you could go to for some fact finding around her let me know sally
fyi i will meet with james on friday when he is back from london to go over the change in reporting for him i gave his review the end of last week but didnt get to review the reporting change i will ask patti to let you know when i am meeting with james on friday wanted you to be in the loop on this particularly when we are getting in front of commercial guys i want this to be well done the training may be great i just wanted to make sure that james knew about avrils trip and that he was aware of the content and delivery on the training looks like he still has some homework to do sally

please print the attachment at end of email in color for me thanks sally

fyi
i couldnt agree with you more mike missed the point of our phone call this week it was not to discuss the fine points of doorstep process or etiquette the point was ownership of an integration process and deadlines that were missed and how telling that when asked bluntly about his comfort level with controls for us operations that mikes response was a deferral to marcelo i have a one hour conference call set up with mike tomorrow this is one of the things that we will discuss sally
julie called me immediately after getting my email message about you her role has changed once again at enron she is running more of a fundamentals group at present wanted to know if you would be interested in that told her that i couldnt speak for you id suggest that you contact her and talk with her even if at first blush that may not be your first interest cant hurt to hear about what she is doing and spend some time with her you may not then be interested in her rotation but youll know more and she will know you fyi she is a university of nebraska graduate sally

the meeting to discuss var reporting and resources ii has been canceled please adjust your schedules to reflect this update many thanks barbara lewis
sally i would like for each trader on the nat gas benchmark to have access to the var reports you publish on the executive reports dpr they should have access to only this report thanks for your attention jeff
after last weeks volatility in the natural gas market i think we all agreed it is imperative that the trading risk controls and reporting groups understand how eack group looks at risk and how we manage the process while our processes are generally good in times of extreme price andor volatility environments we all could be more coordinated it is apparent now that we must get together to look at all aspects of it resources and intraday price risk and var management since it seems these are not now but should be the same thing i would like to set up a meeting regarding these and other management issues and will be in touch i appreciate everyones help jeff

attached are the results from my meetings today
heres the re formatted pge cash report let me know if you have any questions are updates thank you julissa marron
thought you might also like to attend
heres a summary of our conversation so you have points to follow up with general status of the database model fix not represented need to incorporate into common design and standardize might cause some fix rework referential integrity not entirely enforced potential for bad data to develop snapshots from global databases are currently daily this can be easily changed to be more frequent but need to consider implementation as decision on direction of global as a part of commodity logic is made rate information not developed need integration with rate server or mkm preferably mkm need to define how mkm will be used whether just for index names or to obtain actual settlement prices or curves as well application development is not currently occurring on a single version of the database therefore some issues could arise as each development team migrates to the standard this needs to happen relatively quickly specific issues gfdpipemeterssnp probably need to add factype wh ite etc for possible use as validation in kx functionality gasdeallocationdtl this table refers to facility number rather than pipe and meter facility number is an enronism that no other company will recognize pipe and meter general should try to avoid using pipecd as key this value needs to be updateable as pipelines are bought and sold data for facilities is heavily dependent upon enron global facilities database in current design and functionality this needs revisiting as the decision surrounding global is made cpaddrvw this table references only internalcpid and contacttypecd in conjunction with addressid addresses are specific to internalcpid productcd dealnaturecd contacttypecd and regioncd need to add deal nature product and region to ensure correct address usage since many companies align their business along these determinants and addresses may vary counterparty there is a mixture of the usage of global counterparty some areas indicate a certain amount of independence from enrons global counterparty system by having a table to capture commodity logic information on a counterparty such as phone numbers credit ratings etc this would position cl to become independent at a later date yet commodity logic functions as a subset of enron networks and gcp must make entries to indicate the usage of a customer by enron networks to obtain an sap id and support payment processing through to sap so cl could not become independent without further functionality or process changes so why not put the added data requirements within gcp to start with if global moves to commodity logic then this design needs to be revisited for sure there should probably be some standardization between dependenceindependence whether or not cl separates from enron common data status is not included in the views being utilized by the applications i hope the views have been filtered for active status only show was going to check on this concept of mapping others codes to ours for processing is not supported anywhere in these tables perhaps that has been handled in an isolated manner in the fix design this will have to be there for internal release as well as external release this is critical to the hub concept i look forward to sitting in on your meetings surrounding these issues let me know if you have further questions

and their tradespark page touts back office functions for end to end management
you need to go take the tour of this site i believe williams has put together what whalleys vision was a year ago httpwwwwilliamscustomerfirstcomindexjsp
see the comment below on williams confirmation site sounds similar to what we are proposing on cl one question im exploring right now is whether we could save more money from an enron perspective and achieve greater marketability with the model that confirmcorp proposes with automated matching vs the commodity logicwilliams approach that depends on users reviewingapproving confirms weve simply put the current process online so to speak we need to push for a more radical changeimprovement on a faster timeline i still believe confirms is the correct area to be focusing on as i mentioned in our meeting with louise but we need to seriously review what we propose to deliver and how is confirmcorp a viable company to bring under the enron umbrella i think we should be concerned that late entry with less functionality will erode our ability to sign up customers i dont think each large marketer will want to log in to several sites to clear their confirmations with each of their large counterparties can we find out if williams has further plans for their service that would compete with commodity logic

these are the preliminary results of the global systems audit not too bad

you might want to attend this meeting if you can we did some brainstorming today on what how a commodity logic payment module should be and came up with some options that are quite revolutionary it entails some risk but also has revenue potential as well we want to run it by both you and tom to see if this is a direction you want to head if youre not available then i can spend time with you to give you the overview
i organized our thoughts from yesterday into an outline we can follow this also gives us a place to start to record our factsassumptions as we identify them i moved the document into oenergyopsopm hours survey for now so we can all access
the info from the outsourcing offsite has been loaded to the development environment of the global risk operations home page take a look i scanned and didnt see anything i wouldnt want to have in production but thought you might want to check before we move it into production once you say okay well move it out and then we need you to send the memo out that introduces the website httpgrodevcorpenroncom click the link and then select outsourcing ase studio workshop under the global heading in the body of the page

dear cassandra thanks for the message i believe it if fully understood by us and the individual risk management groups that explanations must be validated by the traders are you in addition saying that your group who has been very helpful in the past will no longer help us understand the cause of violationsnotifications to me this appears contrary to a team spirit attitude and not reflective of what you and i and vlady and i had discussed earlier today also we are working toward getting the memos out earlier and this is a real set back to that process thoughts to shona wilsonnaenronenron michael beniencorpenronenron chris abelhouectect daniel falconecorpenronenron cc veronica valdezhouectect sally beckhouectect subject limit violations and notifications process shona to share with the others our telephone discussion the notification template was not my request it was requested directly by skilling i know your group is working hard to meet mangagement expectations and in accordance with your request below market risk is happy to help you transition into this revised reporting format by reviewing the template prior to your distribution until you are comfortable with the reporting requirements the new pl notification limits and limit changes that will be in effect next tuesday should dramatically decrease the number of notifications so that should help it probably makes sense to re distribute the policy to your business unit controllers and the traders so they understand the policy requirements another issue that we discussed yesterday is the source of the violation explanations these should be provided to you by the head trader of that commodity group under the policy that commodity group manager is responsible for compliance with the risk management policy for the commodities under his responsibility along with the head of the energy ops for that commodity group if the traders are not providing these explanations to you or to your counterparts ops desk head business unit controller ill be happy to send them an e mail explaining their compliance obligation under the policy why dont you talk to each of the business unit controllers consider whether a process is already in place for this feedback as i understand it is for global products for example and if youd like me to send an e mail to whoever youre having difficulty with i will just let me know who our market risk desk heads will be happy to review their explanations but the problem is they can see whether theyre short or long and how the market moved in comparison but its the trader that can and should explain why they took a position whether theyre adjusting it based on the market moves etc let me know what else i can do to help streamline the process regards cassandra
as a result new spreadsheet
thanks for taking the time i appreciate it hope all is going well we havent had much to talk about lately best regards shona to shona wilsonnaenronenron cc subject chris abel shona i just wanted to make sure you knew what a great job chris does as a liason between your group and market risk management on all the dpr and limit issues he is extremely responsive to our mrm inquiries and requests for information and has been instrumental in helping me gather information and understand the dpr reporting process so that i can prepare better and more meaninful analyses for the bod and for rick buy and hes been a pleasure to work with throughout all the changes to the notification process and appears willing to embrace suggestions on how to improve risk reporting processes further your entire groups teamwork and work ethic has enabled me to add value in my new position here and while i got the opportunity to express this via pep for you and eugenio i didnt do a review on chris so i wanted to make sure you knew regards cassandra

gentlemen steve herber asked this morning that i send to him and dave neubauer a copy of the arbitration award in this matter given that stan horton has taken the position that no further business will be done with oneok until the measurement issue is straightened out and that steve and dave are in negotiations with oneok right now per my discussion with steve i will send to him a three ring binder headed confidential northern v oneok and that contains the measurement agreement the operating agreement whose dispute resolution language is incorporated into the measurement agreement and the arbitration award given that i think kathy r has that information in omaha i would ask that she do the same for dave neubauer kathy could you call to confirm that you have the documents and can do this please treat the binder as highly confidential as we arbitrated under a confidentiality agreement that goes for any copy of the arbitration award in anyones possession if you are aware of anyone else who should receive such a binder please let me know britt
dave heard back from terry spencer of oneok today that oneok has changed its position on a couple of key issues first terry indicated that oneok now agrees that the arbitration award is not limited in effect to just the past period they agree that the award interprets the measurement agreement and that the interpretation is not limited to just the retroactive effect it is not clear how broad they think the prospective effect of the award is but any change is significant on this issue second terry indicated that oneok is very likely to ask for a special test of the meters as a way of resolving the april may issue and implicitly the issue of whether the meters are ok going forward this is also a big change as oneok has refused to call a special test since the initial demand letter we sent them last fall spencer indicated oneok was drafting a letter that would clarify their position in light of that and of the apparent progress dave made stan has agreed we should hold off on the demand letter until we see their letter once dave gets it well all take a look and decide the next step thanks df
please review the attached letter to oneok and the supporting imbalance statement dollar valuation statement and oneok ptr shrink balance and interest calculation detail report once i get the go ahead from you i will email this package to delaine kurth we still prefer to send this package out today so please get back to me this afternoon if possible if we do not hear from everyone we will still send it to delaine as someone from each of your staff has already reviewed and agreed to the language in the letter rick
i asked ken cessac to call jerry knight who is the administrative assistant that john sommer asked ken to call to get daily ptr from oneok knight had been sending ken daily ptr information on a once weekly basis through september but then stopped i asked ken to ask knight the obvious question why did he stop sending ken the daily ptr ken did so today and was told that terry spencer told knight to stop sending ken the information knight didnt say why he had been told that knight told ken that he would now tell spencer that ken had made inquiry about the stoppage of the daily ptr ken wondered whether spencer did this to see if ken noticed and objected to the lack of daily ptr weird kens letter of todays date regarding the second measurement incident has gone out by telefax to oneok many thanks to all who responded on that oneoks response to our first letter which i mentioned in a previous e mail has or will shortly be distributed ill keep you advised britt

vernon please be prepared to discuss how we have our pools set up should help us or hurt us yes depending upon how you set up your pool transactions it will make a difference on how you may be scheduled in order to maintain the highest possibility that one would not get allocated through a pool from a receipt location we do inform our customers that the take away shipper should be firm and should not be receiving any gas from any one else on the transaction the more daisy chain transactions at a pool the less reliable the gas becomes during an allocation of course the highest reliability is not go through a pool at all and go from point to point beatrice fits into the picture and if this is going to cause additional allocations unsure about this question if demarc gets allocated are big contract gets frozen so we can not adjust our nominations not sure what he means by big contract get frozen but any time an allocation occurs the shipper always has the ability to make nomination changes the risk is that any changes that one may do could affect the outcome of the allocation from the previous allocation we do recommend that our customers do not make any changes at a point of allocation unless it is necessary ets can not guarantee they will not be effected it all depends upon what any one else within the chain is also doing the shipper can make changes to either their quantity or ranks without being considered a new nomination line item if this is the case should we release our contract to ourselves in the field zone so we would then have two contracts which would allow us to not have the same problem as described above unsure about this question review the amount of capacity to and through demarc by line vernons specific example that includes all the cycles vernons unsure about this question can you have an allocation after the timely cycle yes our priority going to demarc from the field if we have our nominations in on time and do not change them should be primary if you have primary rights dependent upon k rights to demarc what would happen if we were on time and got all of our gas confirmed to demarc and then one of our customers changes their nomination in our pool there is potential that your customer could affect you at demarc once again it depends upon what his other transaction are at the point he can make a mistake that could affect you we cannot guarantee what his does

jo williams left me a message this morning requesting that during the morning gas control meeting that when allocations are announced that the shippers that were cut be given without marketing asking for the information i had this information this morning but no one asked for it i told jo someone had been coming to the meetings with that information available and it had been given out when asked for but she failed to remember that i guess we should just announce who got cut when we talk about the allocations and if it gets to be too much information marketing will let us know john buchanan

john and terry could you check into having a business objects report done for all groupings with the following information previous cyclce nomination current nomination confirmation schedule confirmation piece is not critical if that prolongs getting the report the reason for the report gas control needs to know what changes have taken place and this will prevent the teams from doing a manual report if we already have access to something similar to this let me know i would like to be able run this report during cycle i think i am probably asking for the moon but that would be the best time for gas control thanks lynn

to gas control from shelley corman subject fire drills and emergency response periodically we review our procedures during fire drills in the building historically i understand that the gas controllers on duty have not moved to the stairwells during a drill we need to change that practice we are required by the fire marshall to have everyone move to the stairwells during future fire drills the short time normally required to be away from the console until the all clear is sounded should not impact the integrity of the pipeline systems we are also reviewing our short notice emergency response procedures we have excellent procedures for events such as hurricanes but we are preparing for events such as a threat that would require everyone to leave the building immediately our interim offsite location in these situations is the enron hanger at intercontinental airport in the near future we will be conducting a drill of these procedures so dont be surprised if someone from our management team comes into gas control and asks you to proceed to the hanger on short notice thanks in advance for your co operation and thank you for the great job everyone is doing
mikesteve we have verified all of the volume information and our numbers are correct their numbers do not include prior period adjustments in the correct production month and our pvr volumes are correct and agree with the worksheets that they sent us even though they didnt use the correct volumes for the pvr on their worksheets we still cannot figure out how they got to the amounts that they invoiced us please let me know if we are going to go back to those months that we underbilled them so that nng can recoup that money if you have any questions let me know thanks raetta

dear sandra i sincerely apologize if i offended you in any way wednesday evening that was certainly never my intention i let my competitive emotions take over i was attempting to compare myself with other brokers not any specific shop if i singled certain brokers out that was not my intention i was honestly trying to stress that i really work hard to earn the business i can truly say that i slept very little that night reflecting on things that were discussed in our dinner after pondering the discussion about the firmness of physical gas i was afraid that i did not communicate my point well and insulted your intelligence and your ability to judge the intelligence of your brokers i certainly would never purposely do that i respect your reputation in the market and your knowledge of the market upon reflection of the conversation i did not communicate my points concerning physical and i cannot say enough that it was not my intention to insult you whether you work at enron or not i have reviewed the conversation with steve and jon ray is at lunch and i can honestly say i was trying to point out enrons strength in the marketplace i chose the west as the example because of the volatility i certainly meant it on how the market has changed not how enron manipulates the market or is putting traders out of jobs i am embarrassed that i lost my composure i felt you were trying to challenge our group to raise our level of game which you did i did not mean to dominate the conversation from natsources point of view steve and i agreed that we both could have handled the discussions much better i do not blame steve as my boss or jon as the desk head for not stopping the conversation i am an adult and a professional so i take full responsibility as brokers our job is to communicate clearly we failed in this regard i obviously would like to make it up to you and your firm i hope my lack of composure does not cost my entire firm any of enrons business i hope i can work through the issues i created for the gulf desk i will take it personally to take your points about our desk and make them happen i do not want you uncomfortable with anyone who speaks with you your respect for ray is obvious and i will try to support whatever you decide to the fullest sincerely aaron

this is great i want to use it at our upcoming credit conference thanks rick
i like this slide from tara can we use somewhere rick
i will be unable to attend this meeting as i will be in canada meeting with banks bill bradford could attend in my absense if dan thinks appropriate rick
great this is exactly how i want everything in rac to work rick
chip is assigned to north america primarily but we asked him to get up to speed on the india situation in case a new deal should arise there that requires rac input he is a sharp guy with lots of project finance experience and also worked in london for eastern if you dont want him involved and a transaction arises it will be difficult to get someone up to speed quickly given the complexities rick
you all should have received instruction from sheila w on the system for salaries i need that info late today so i can look at over the weekend numbers are due monday am rick
fyi
fyi rick
lets discuss this before we make offer rick
are these numbers consistent with your expectations we will submit to hr if no onjections traditionally sutton has looked at the range and made the decision where to be inside the range i dont know if skilling will do the same i have a voice mail into him to see rick
wow whats behind this not that i think it isnt a very prudent decision rick
tx please stay on top of this and pass on info to bradford for inclusion in our overall calif analysis rick
yes we should present fx exposure at every meeting just like credit exposure tec format as before rick
we are probably ok for now since we got the space from networks rick
fyi
please schedule
fyi wasnt there a discussion on this at prc rick
i really appreciate it when people take the time to acknowledge marks efforts and others in rac as well thanks for the feedback rick
hi thanks for the note remember that karen reads all my mail so dont send anything too personal time to get back into studying it will be over before you know it and the four years is a small fraction of your working life so keep at it i will look into london for your spring break send me the exact times you have off love dad

fyi
i will be working on all rac bonuses on wednesday and ask that each of you review your departments bonuses on thursday so that all of rac can be submitted on friday thanks rick
i guess i dont have strong feelings if a dash is written here or not but i do care that a troubled situation receive the attention it requires to avoid getting in deeper there always seems to be reluctance in uk to have a dash prepared steve always used a huge amount of energy on justifying the task we all know that if problem deals are not addressed they always get worse maybe michael could be led to suggest an alternative memo or approach a problem deal memo if you all think a dash is the best approach do it and i dont care if they dont sign it once the website is functional it will be helpful to have a complete history of deals and having these kind of memos in dash format will aid this process one final thought michael is quite supportive of our effort and i think we should pick battles carefully rick
pam please send this to rac worldwide tx rick
activity levels in credit risk management crm have never been higher due to very volatile commodity markets growth in ees and many other factors in order to address these market changes effective now ken curry will transfer from rick carsons due diligence group to crm and report to bill bradford ken has a strong background in credit related issues and should be able to immediately add value to the crm group it is fortunate that adequate depth exists within rac to be able to realign personnel as market needs suggest please join me in congratulating ken on his move and in wishing him success in this new assignment rick buy
sorry to hear your news thanks for letting me know rick
lets have a brief meeting on this ill have karen set up tx rick
this looks good possibly dont need last two items we need to decide when to review this once it is live to see if it is taking off also what does t aking off mean certainly after a month see what others think about this list and then we can decide what our plan should be ill talk to you in a day or two rick
thanks you guys need a rest have a great holiday rick
test

lets discuss brazilei strategy rick
rick i suggest that you ted d hardy and i visit by phone in the next couple of days to further discuss communication between the various groups involved it would be useful for d hardy and i to further describe some of the behind the scenes conversations that occurred involving the principal groups ie rac acctg logistics legal and commercial and the sequence and timing of those conversations i believe it will be most useful for you to have a better understanding of the interaction among the groups as this is discussed among senior management in the coming weeks i firmly believe that the accountingcommcl support and logistics groups got much to close to commercial and were not second guessing some of the key issues some of our more difficult conversations and resistance when collecting information came from commercial support and logistics not just commercial given the nature of discussions around this issue it is important that we have this conference call some time this week let me know when you have some time or alternatively have karen schedule with sharon on a related note at some point there was a struggle within liquids concerning control over trading in the helsinki office between london and ilkka although the helsinki office was originally intended only as a marketing office in some respects it evolved into a stand alone operation i can not see where there was a conscious decision for it to be more than a marketing outpost and it would appear the decision concerning the amount of control enjoyed by ilkka and his team came solely down to k beasley i would like to discuss this in this call as well
fyi j nowlan said he followed up with a call to henkka and was left fairly confused as to why he suggested k beasley and g novokovic should not be involved ted pass on to sally et al as you see fit

chip is assigned to north america primarily but we asked him to get up to speed on the india situation in case a new deal should arise there that requires rac input he is a sharp guy with lots of project finance experience and also worked in london for eastern if you dont want him involved and a transaction arises it will be difficult to get someone up to speed quickly given the complexities rick

i will be working on all rac bonuses on wednesday and ask that each of you review your departments bonuses on thursday so that all of rac can be submitted on friday thanks rick
i guess i dont have strong feelings if a dash is written here or not but i do care that a troubled situation receive the attention it requires to avoid getting in deeper there always seems to be reluctance in uk to have a dash prepared steve always used a huge amount of energy on justifying the task we all know that if problem deals are not addressed they always get worse maybe michael could be led to suggest an alternative memo or approach a problem deal memo if you all think a dash is the best approach do it and i dont care if they dont sign it once the website is functional it will be helpful to have a complete history of deals and having these kind of memos in dash format will aid this process one final thought michael is quite supportive of our effort and i think we should pick battles carefully rick
pam please send this to rac worldwide tx rick

connie as you begin to tie down the assumptions on the various models i would like to conduct model reviews like we used to do in ei a single meeting where the commercial people responsible for the business and relevant functional people all gather with you and i i would also suggest rick buy attend to review the model and the key assumptions the goal is less of a police function and more of an education process to increase understanding of the business also i think i am going to want someone dedicated to reviewing the work on the dabhol model as we consider various renegotiation scenarios the decision making is too important to not have oversight lastly have you reviewed the modeling both in esa and at rac done on cuiaba in connection with the recent board presentation jim

as mentioned in our floor meeting recently attached are listings of teams that we are forming to better address the business needs of enron as it expands both in volume and scope supervisors of each rac sub group provided the names for the groups with the understanding that they may have to be adjusted from time to time only the more senior people were included but others will be included as appropriate many will have to be multidimensional there will be no formal leader of the teams because each member is responsible for the activities of the team regardless of the rac group that you are in following are several thoughts concerning this process for consideration the purpose of this exercise is to better serve the customer the commercial business units and achieve this within our control framework ancillary benefits include cross training of rac employees and heightened awareness of rac issues de silo ization all existing reporting relationships remain unchanged for the moment successful implementation of this effort will require a positive attitude among the teams existing rac responsibilities remain in effect teams should meet weekly at least to discuss issues transactions will require more frequent informal meetings there are no excuses for forgetting to consider the impact on a deal of credit market risk or our portfolio all team members are responsible for all aspects of a transaction offer to help out if needed if formal cross training is necessary force it to happen encourage weak links in team to perform each quarter rac management will conduct portfolio reviews of the business unit with the team present this may take one quarter to implement if it makes sense to sit together for logistical reasons try to arrange it with your supervisor individual performance on the teams will be strongly considered in the prc and compensation processes the existing ees team has been quite successful and in large part was a catalyst to the recent reorganization there you can have an impact this process should begin immediately thanks in advance for your cooperation in this effort rick

connie as you begin to tie down the assumptions on the various models i would like to conduct model reviews like we used to do in ei a single meeting where the commercial people responsible for the business and relevant functional people all gather with you and i i would also suggest rick buy attend to review the model and the key assumptions the goal is less of a police function and more of an education process to increase understanding of the business also i think i am going to want someone dedicated to reviewing the work on the dabhol model as we consider various renegotiation scenarios the decision making is too important to not have oversight lastly have you reviewed the modeling both in esa and at rac done on cuiaba in connection with the recent board presentation jim

ryan in the follow up to the meeting we had on wednesday i would like to reinforce one point i made i feel strongly that i cannot support the valuations my group has produced so far for the ljmraptor related transactions without examination of all the related legal documents i feel that we did solid work based on verbal information but i cannot guarantee the quality of the final product without looking at the contracts these transactions are too complex and controversial to bypass due diligence requirements that you would expect from any professional vince kaminski

hi rick chris abel mentioned to me at the beginning of the quarter that i none of us had to sign off on the dpr and that our viewing it alone was sufficient i see though there still is the sign off button on the bottom of the report is viewing it enough jeff
rickbilldavid generally we have managed to keep our main counterparts transacting but things are tight we are signing netting agreements and agreeing to collateral threshholds but we are negotiating hard where we think that we will be so close to collateral lines in the next few months that we would actually have to post as we go into this week we need to hold on to those we have incrementally open up a few more and start to get people to business as usual amongst the things that continues to be missing are the official story we have access to the newspaper here too good communication regarding global relationships and calendar and status of new developments regarding credit facilities equity issuanceraising not that some of it is getting through it just comes through random channels and we know very little more than our counterparts that have a subscription to the wall street journal to that end it has been suggested here that houston pr with racfinance develop a daily script of talking points for the masses we have traders and credit people talking all day to counterparts they really could use a strong story to tell without have to think about it i am very confident that i can tell a reasonable story myself but i am concerned that i do not have all the facts at my disposal and my guess is that the average tradercredit specialist is probably at a greater disadvantage thoughts ted
rick buy has requested that we maintain an up to date list of all rac employees home phone number cell phone number and home address please verify your contact information with the assistant in your group by the end of the day today on a go forward basis if this information changes please notify the assistant in your group as soon as possible thanks so much for your help

mark the word on the street is that the newpower folks are getting further in trouble ie strange trading activity etc looks and smells a little like the old ees couple of opps get another shareholder on side and demand an enron led audit to confirm financial and operating health followed up by hostile exit of mgt team if significant issues arise issues obviously pushes us into another level of complicityfiduciary in a blow up or bankruptcy not unlike the issues we faced with kafus et al however given our continued interest a significant control issue could result in a significant acceleration of a write off of our existing position plus any outstanding credit i would recommend we force the management team to submit to a detailed audit as a part of a united shareholder iniative lets discuss rick buy what is our current credit position gregjohn do you have a view on this one rick causey we probably need a more permanent solution ot the newpower issue regards delainey
if we have the flexibility to afford a potential significant acceleration of newpower lossesliquidity issues ie going to zero and we feel we have our trade credit adequately secured then the right call is probably to abandon the seats mark what is your view regards delainey

ray we are working on revising the dash template in order that it can be readily used for asset divestitures contract terminations and amendments to transactions the new dash the template of which should be completed early next week would be prepared earlier in the process that was typically the case in the past would contain a rac recommendation and would then be used as the approval document for the appropriate committee transaction review or bankruptcy management to recommend or approve a transaction this is consistent with past practice although presumably only business unit rac and legal sign offs would occur prior to committee review and with your memo of earlier today your thoughts as to how the approval process should occur after a dash is prepared would be appreciated regards dave

as mentioned in our floor meeting recently attached are listings of teams that we are forming to better address the business needs of enron as it expands both in volume and scope supervisors of each rac sub group provided the names for the groups with the understanding that they may have to be adjusted from time to time only the more senior people were included but others will be included as appropriate many will have to be multidimensional there will be no formal leader of the teams because each member is responsible for the activities of the team regardless of the rac group that you are in following are several thoughts concerning this process for consideration the purpose of this exercise is to better serve the customer the commercial business units and achieve this within our control framework ancillary benefits include cross training of rac employees and heightened awareness of rac issues de silo ization all existing reporting relationships remain unchanged for the moment successful implementation of this effort will require a positive attitude among the teams existing rac responsibilities remain in effect teams should meet weekly at least to discuss issues transactions will require more frequent informal meetings there are no excuses for forgetting to consider the impact on a deal of credit market risk or our portfolio all team members are responsible for all aspects of a transaction offer to help out if needed if formal cross training is necessary force it to happen encourage weak links in team to perform each quarter rac management will conduct portfolio reviews of the business unit with the team present this may take one quarter to implement if it makes sense to sit together for logistical reasons try to arrange it with your supervisor individual performance on the teams will be strongly considered in the prc and compensation processes the existing ees team has been quite successful and in large part was a catalyst to the recent reorganization there you can have an impact this process should begin immediately thanks in advance for your cooperation in this effort rick

this is fine by me rick buy
thanks now i just have to convince jeff rick
thanks for the feedback i sent my best guy there so i hope there is improvement we have been talking to a candidate for credit that ted will be discussing with you soon hopefully we can make progress there also i want complete buy in from you and john on this guy before we proceed separately the scrap metals meeting we had with causey went well we will reconvene in two weeks to see where we are thanks again for the feedback i was a little worried about ted after the md disappointment but it seems he has recovered rick
sounds fine to me does it make sense to run resume past brown and sherriff prior to bringing him over also is the idea he would be a director sr director or vp each of these paths has consequences as you know rick
i liked him alot seems ready willing and able to make a move what are your thoughts rick
thanks for your note i want to wish you the best of luck in ees as far as racs issues with ees i would suggest getting together with tribolet and getting some of the lists that have been put together as part of the task force i would also suggest attending the task force meeting providing ees management is agreeable to get a better picture of what is going on again i hate to see you go but it will still be value added to rac and enron have fun rick
ted tells me you guys have already taken action on this which greatly relieves me i did not want this procrastinated on i have a meeting scheduled with rick causey and will get up to speed on what exactly what has transpired prior to that meeting thanks for giving this your immediate attention rick
a doorstep inspection of this business was performed in accordance with our procedures and apparently this business is a disaster we need immediate action on this up to and including shutting it down this was the worst we have seen at enron and i dont even want to put in this email what i heard was going on there we need a coordinated solution here asap to avoid a real disaster if there isnt one already ill speak with rick causey here about what immediate action we should take but the more you guys can dig into this the better more to come rick

great this is exactly how i want everything in rac to work rick
chip is assigned to north america primarily but we asked him to get up to speed on the india situation in case a new deal should arise there that requires rac input he is a sharp guy with lots of project finance experience and also worked in london for eastern if you dont want him involved and a transaction arises it will be difficult to get someone up to speed quickly given the complexities rick
you all should have received instruction from sheila w on the system for salaries i need that info late today so i can look at over the weekend numbers are due monday am rick
fyi
lets discuss this before we make offer rick
are these numbers consistent with your expectations we will submit to hr if no onjections traditionally sutton has looked at the range and made the decision where to be inside the range i dont know if skilling will do the same i have a voice mail into him to see rick
no the conclusion is incorrect the peakers help to mitigate the risk created by market positions maybe just change the last sentence to read because the peakers offset the contract the var is substantially reduced rick
wow whats behind this not that i think it isnt a very prudent decision rick
tx please stay on top of this and pass on info to bradford for inclusion in our overall calif analysis rick
yes we should present fx exposure at every meeting just like credit exposure tec format as before rick
we are probably ok for now since we got the space from networks rick

fyi rick
i guess i dont have strong feelings if a dash is written here or not but i do care that a troubled situation receive the attention it requires to avoid getting in deeper there always seems to be reluctance in uk to have a dash prepared steve always used a huge amount of energy on justifying the task we all know that if problem deals are not addressed they always get worse maybe michael could be led to suggest an alternative memo or approach a problem deal memo if you all think a dash is the best approach do it and i dont care if they dont sign it once the website is functional it will be helpful to have a complete history of deals and having these kind of memos in dash format will aid this process one final thought michael is quite supportive of our effort and i think we should pick battles carefully rick
pam please send this to rac worldwide tx rick
activity levels in credit risk management crm have never been higher due to very volatile commodity markets growth in ees and many other factors in order to address these market changes effective now ken curry will transfer from rick carsons due diligence group to crm and report to bill bradford ken has a strong background in credit related issues and should be able to immediately add value to the crm group it is fortunate that adequate depth exists within rac to be able to realign personnel as market needs suggest please join me in congratulating ken on his move and in wishing him success in this new assignment rick buy

spoke w skilling re oi binary decision he is willing to enter into the deal his rational is that he thinks we will be ok on owc in the final analysis he did say to reserve for the deal adequately and structure it as appropriate for the circumstances he also wanted to know if there is anything different here than on owc i told him that it wasnt significantly different both strong underlying businesses with huge event risk attached lets get dash completed and then i will voice mail jeff w specifics and get his verbal signature rick
spoke with john sherriff this am re prc for london rac people john said they included our people for cross calibration purposes but we could rank our people where we saw fit so i dont think there is any issue here the houston prc rankings should stand unless there was new information brought to light to you steve that calls into question a persons ranking sheila please double check with the london hr people that this is straightened out thanks rick

as mentioned in our floor meeting recently attached are listings of teams that we are forming to better address the business needs of enron as it expands both in volume and scope supervisors of each rac sub group provided the names for the groups with the understanding that they may have to be adjusted from time to time only the more senior people were included but others will be included as appropriate many will have to be multidimensional there will be no formal leader of the teams because each member is responsible for the activities of the team regardless of the rac group that you are in following are several thoughts concerning this process for consideration the purpose of this exercise is to better serve the customer the commercial business units and achieve this within our control framework ancillary benefits include cross training of rac employees and heightened awareness of rac issues de silo ization all existing reporting relationships remain unchanged for the moment successful implementation of this effort will require a positive attitude among the teams existing rac responsibilities remain in effect teams should meet weekly at least to discuss issues transactions will require more frequent informal meetings there are no excuses for forgetting to consider the impact on a deal of credit market risk or our portfolio all team members are responsible for all aspects of a transaction offer to help out if needed if formal cross training is necessary force it to happen encourage weak links in team to perform each quarter rac management will conduct portfolio reviews of the business unit with the team present this may take one quarter to implement if it makes sense to sit together for logistical reasons try to arrange it with your supervisor individual performance on the teams will be strongly considered in the prc and compensation processes the existing ees team has been quite successful and in large part was a catalyst to the recent reorganization there you can have an impact this process should begin immediately thanks in advance for your cooperation in this effort rick

based on the call from rod boschee today noting meetings set up with southwest lou and larry campbell will be attending i believe it would be helpful for dave schafer or a rep from communications to attend as well pge appears to be getting ready to divert attention to us worthwhile to read the pge media statement at the end of this lotus notes mike
 look closelygif

 cjpg
just a short note to let you know that i received a call from rod bosche of pge apprising me of a meeting pge will be having with sw gas this tuesday they will be discussing pcb issues and the sampling results from the pge system from discussions with louie a media statement is being prepared by them which louie has a copy of the statement is a little harsh and makes some statements which are incorrect louie and i are planning to attend this meeting in las vegas to possibly assist in making some suggestions about rewording their statement and provide some additional insight and history on the transwestern system with respect to pcbs the results of this meeting will be forwarded at a later date
 how to discourage harassment in the officempeg
on tuesday of this week lou soldano and i attended a meeting between the above referenced parties concerning the issue of pcbs which had migrated into the pge system southwest gas is a customer of pges and recieves natural gas from pge for delivery to its customers pge has prepared a media statement which it is going to be sent out to those parties which receive gas from interconnects testing positive for pcbs as of today only the customer base around needles california will see the pge statement the two issues of note first transwestern was able to make some minor changes to the media statement to more clearly show in the statement that this release of pcbs was an isolated incident and that all parties are diligently incorporating measures to contain and manage this release a copy of the revised media statement is available upon request from louie or myself second pge and southwest gas have jointly agreed to conduct immediate sampling activities at downstream interconnect locations on the southwest gas system to determine if the pcbs have spread into parts of their system results of this sampling will be presented in a meeting tentatively scheduled in a couple of weeks transwestern will probably atttend this meeting
the air permit application apen for the the turbine power unit exchange for the la plata cs was submitted to the state of colorado a meeting was attended with southwest gas and pge in las vegas concerning pges forthcoming media statement which it will distribute to the selected sectors of the public informing them of the discovery of pcbs received from transwestern southwest gas is a customer of pge pge and southwest gas have jointly agreed to conduct sampling activities on the southwest gas system to determine presence and extent of possible pcb contamination on the southwest system attended the cross functional training meeting in albuquerque

palazzo william williampalazzonypagov writes to the nyisotechexchange discussion list in response to some e mails on the subject report we offer the following comments we believe expressing the locational requirement as a function of the capability period peak sends a better price signal to lses some lse loads will have larger peak in summer and others may be balanced or even peak in the winter seasonal icap would facilitate capacity exchanges between summer and winter peaking areas as a practical matter the requirement can be expressed any way for this exercise we just left it as a percentage of the summer peak because it provides a reference point to the current requirement and illustrates an order of magnitude of the potential reduction in the winter requirement that may be justified through an examination of the seasonal risk we agree completely that all issues including deficiency charges modeling etc must be considered in any methodological change there was no intent to suggest everything else would remain unchanged

chadjwagnerdynegycom writes to the nyisotechexchange discussion list this raises concerns about what functions any iso should take on in the long run here the iso used its limited resources ones which many members want directed to specific high priority projects such as virtual bidding to perform a study on icap that we did not know about until a flurry of emails arrive the point is the iso better serves by focusing its talent and limited time on facilitating the operation of a workable reliable cost effective and efficient power market and by performing studies consistent with member priorities not by performing studies at the request of one member unless they are part of a clearly defined and approved process like that for interconnections the iso should work as a market facilitator and as such expend its talents on providing accurate and timely pricing billing and tracking of energy transactions within into and out of new york the nyisos need to periodically address market reliability issues and to initiate studies should continue in the near term market participants can raise concerns about reliability issues or submit studies they perform to the iso and if the iso believes that they have merit we can all review and debate them and not be advantaged or disadvantaged by some activities that the iso decided to undertake with one member the iso should not pirate market participants opportunities to analyze the dynamics of generation availability transmission icap and demand to discover areas for investment what better stimulus than roi is there to seek out opportunities and eradicate inefficiencies in the market let the market work and the iso facilitate chad wagner dynegy
marketrelationsnyisocom writes to the nyisotechexchange discussion list dear market participants as many of you know and as some of you have commented about the iso performed additional computer analysis regarding locational icap requirements at nypas request early this year we did so after agreeing that the issue nypa raised was relevant to our market and would not detract from other work we were conducting the results were shared with nypa in march with the understanding that nypa would use the study results to promote a dialogue among market participants on the issues raised the nyiso would like to formalize the process of contract work on issues relevant to the new york market or decide to discontinue it by reviewing with market participants a proposed protocol indicating appropriate areas for study and appropriate disclosure guidelines we will request the operating business issues and management committee chairs to add this proposed protocol for discussion to committee agendas for may we look forward to working with all market participants on reaching agreement on an acceptable process that is both useful and fair to everyone regards mollie lampi nyiso senior attorney

in an effort to protect enrons e mail system from harmful viruses the global messaging team has implemented an inbound and outbound cluster of mailsweeper servers what does that mean to you the user all inbound and outbound internet mail is passed through a set of servers that will scan each message for viruses malicious code business related content and inappropriate content inbound internet mail that contains the following attachment types will be quarantined held for delivery vbs exe com bat cmd if you are the intended recipient of one of these e mails you will receive an automatic notification with instructions on how to get your legitimate e mail released from quarantine we have taken these measures to protect our e mail environment from harmful e mail viruses we believe that these protections will result in less down time for your e mail in the event that enron gets hit with a virus or malicious code

john lou cutty bill i want to bring this issue back up for your attention as i know that everyone is very busy during the epa title v inspection at the laguna cs this past week barbara bernacek the laguna environmental person was present she had been asked to be there by the epa during our tour of the facility she casually asked if any progress or decision had been made by enron management towards remediation assistance in the groundwater issue at the laguna cs i had informed her that we were still actively discussing this issue and would contact her in the near future concerning managements decision i would appreciate it very much if each of you would revisit my memo below and then lets discuss what should be done and the approach we should take in addressing the lagunas concern about a proactive approach to reaching cleanup and closure
mike id suggest we move on any decon work for our facilities at the same time the find of pcbs in the compressors will undoubtedly be the subject of next weeks meeting the presence of pcbs does not limit their use at that station pge would be reluctant to move the engines around on the system depending upon the concentrations at the time they may be restricted in their ability to sell or reuse the compressors im not aware of any true decon process for such equipment vector may be able to propose a piecemeal decon project but it would likely be expensive and involve the outage of the equipment for a significant period of time we might want to gather a group of folks and go over the agenda and our pososible response to a request by pge to take down thier compression
rich thanx for the sampling update ill pass it along to the apropriate parties a cursory look at the data shows it to be inconsistently up and down as expected with no glaring increases anything urgent we need to discuss

i spoke to john nystedt the contact person for the navajo nation fw service concerning the need to do endangered plants and animal surveys at the two cs on reservation lands i had sent to him the usgs quad sheets of the cs sites for review today he stated that he didnt think surveys would be needed at either location due to the fact that there had been historic disturbance at each location and that there was no sensitive habitiats in or near the cs sites which would warrant surveys however because of the issue of tribal lands he was going to discuss this issue with the navajo nation director and verify his opinion and he would let transwestern know on monday of next week as to what the tribes final decision would be but he was almost sure that the trib would recommend no surveys john has faxed to me the list of approved botonists and boilogists which are approved to do work on the reservation i have contacted a number of individuals on the list and they are prepared to do the boilogical surveys next week in the unlikely event a survey is required
guys i received harrells memo concerning the fuel use for the turbine and the fact that you had to reduce gas producer speeds to comply with the permits fuel use requirements my question is how does the fuel use compare with what solar says the fuel use should be if we can get solar to provide written guarantees and up the fuel use value for the turbine we can up the fuel value on the permit the state of colorado perceives increased fuel use beyond manufacturers values as the turbine not operating correctly and in need of mechanical adjustment from their eyes this would be a strong indication of excess emissions and i think there evaluation would hold some merit anyway i dont want to send up a red flag to the state of colorado would you contact solar and compare their fuel use values with what the monitors say the turbine is burning at la plata then let me know if worse gets to worse i may be able to use another tactic but only as a last resort

today i spoke with jean calhoun of the arizona chapter of the nature conservancy about the proposed sundevil pipeline construction project she was very cordial and appreciative concerning transwesterns proactive efforts to contact not only her office but all federal and state agencies which may have jurisdictional lands impacted by the project although the proposed route of the pipeline corridor has not been firmly established she did offer some general yet valuable information concerning the geographic area which exists south of flagstaff into roughly northern phoenix the area south of flagstaff into phoenix crosses of three major ecological regions identified by the tnc with major biological diversity of plants and animals the tnc has completed published studies on two of the regions the tnc has requested that should this project be apporved these publications be used to assist in the environmental studies which will need to be completed prior to construction and approval by ferc to the south and east of flagstaff is a sensitive portfolio consisting of the verde river which is of ecologic interest due to the abundance of endangered fish and bird species which live in and around the area of the river this river could be impacted by the pipeline due to its meandering in a southwesterly direction across arizona i have contacted other state and federal governmental agencies in addition to the tnc and all parties have expressed difficulity in assessing the environmental impact of a project of this magnitude without knowing the pipeline corridor route part of this concern is due to the extensive and unique biological diversity of arizona i think we will have a better handle on how we address the environmental concerns and opportunities when this piece of the puzzle is completed and also how much more specific and helpful the agencies assistance will be when identified areas are known

 the cruelty of age mildred and chester knew each other from childhood but were in their nineties when they got married they had to wait for mildreds mother to pass away first back in those days there was no hanky panky before marriage so chester and mildred were both still virgins needless to say chester was pretty excited on their wedding night having waited so patiently all these years however mildred was very apprehensive as she had developed a heart condition and would have to tell chester that they could not do it chester is now sitting on the bed wanting mildred to hurry up he detects a little reluctance on her part thinking that she is shy he sends her off to the bathroom to get undressed when she reappears in her silk sateen nightie he gets her to sit next to him on the bed not knowing how to get things started he pulls the first strap on her nightie she blushes just as red as her silk sateen nightie she is really concerned about telling chester about her heart condition in the meantime chester is looking at the first breast he has seen since his own mothers it is hanging there down to her belly button gravity having taken its course over some ninety years he realizes her anxiety but figures she is going have to be helped a little more now he pulls the second strap and sees the second breast unroll downward before him poor mildred is now beside herself she is going to have to tell chester about her heart with a quivering voice and mustering up all her courage she says chester i have acute angina chester says i sure hope so your tits look like hell

first aid tips in a medical emergency knowing what to do can make all the difference here are some tips to help you handle an unexpected injury or illness in the event of decapitation sit the victims body in a chair as best you can balance the head on top of the shoulders and walk away whistling nonchalantly always keep plenty of gauze around the house in case you invent an invisibility potion if you did all you could and the victim still dies pat him or her down for a snickers bar its not like you dont deserve one nothing revives a stroke victim like an eye popping orgasm if someone you know is seriously injured cradle his or her head in your lap and scream why administering cpr is easy just do it like you saw them do on tv that one time in the event of accidental drug overdose call lou reed immediately to stop a nosebleed apply pressure to start a nosebleed apply even greater pressure in short repeated bursts if a person requires artificial respiration and you are of the same sex as the person and no one of the opposite sex is around to perform the procedure you are gay if the heimlich maneuver is ineffective on a choking victim grab his or her neck and squeeze downward to force the food into the stomach if this fails grab the victims ankles and swing him or her around in a circle to force the food up make sure your first aid kid contains a large frilly victorian fan to revive fainting victims if you are a hideous disfigured hunchback and you see someone who is injured and unconscious treat the person then as the person begins to wake up retreat into hiding the person will always wonder who saved him or her and the experience will be poignant in a bittersweet way as a rule of thumb always ask yourself this question what would randolph mantooth do if possible try to be the guy who tells the victim everythings going to be all right while others do the actual work

have fun and a safe thanksgiving richard bill clinton al gore and george w bush died and found themselves standing on the other side of the jordan river looking across at the promised land the archangel michael was standing on the other side and shouted over to the three surprised americans contrary to what you have been taught each of you will have to wade across the jordan river as michael saw their perplexed looks he reassured them by saying dont worry you will sink only proportionally according to your sins on earth the more you have sinned the more you will sink into the water the three american sages of political lore looked at one another trying to determine who shall be the first brave soul to cross the jordan river finally george w bush volunteered to go first slowly he began to wade out into the river and slowly the water began to get higher and higher reaching to his waist george began to sweat thinking all of his sins were coming back to haunt him he was beginning to wonder if he would ever see the other side finally after what seemed liked an eternity he began to emerge on the rivers bank as he ascended to the other side he looked behind him to see which one of the other brave souls was going next a shock of surprise registered on his face as he saw al gore almost in the middle of the river and only his ankles barely touching the water he turned to michael and exclaimed i know al gore al gore is a friend of mine and he has sinned much much more than that before the archangel michael could reply al gore shouted back im standing on clintons shoulders

palazzo william williampalazzonypagov writes to the nyisotechexchange discussion list in response to some e mails on the subject report we offer the following comments we believe expressing the locational requirement as a function of the capability period peak sends a better price signal to lses some lse loads will have larger peak in summer and others may be balanced or even peak in the winter seasonal icap would facilitate capacity exchanges between summer and winter peaking areas as a practical matter the requirement can be expressed any way for this exercise we just left it as a percentage of the summer peak because it provides a reference point to the current requirement and illustrates an order of magnitude of the potential reduction in the winter requirement that may be justified through an examination of the seasonal risk we agree completely that all issues including deficiency charges modeling etc must be considered in any methodological change there was no intent to suggest everything else would remain unchanged

chadjwagnerdynegycom writes to the nyisotechexchange discussion list this raises concerns about what functions any iso should take on in the long run here the iso used its limited resources ones which many members want directed to specific high priority projects such as virtual bidding to perform a study on icap that we did not know about until a flurry of emails arrive the point is the iso better serves by focusing its talent and limited time on facilitating the operation of a workable reliable cost effective and efficient power market and by performing studies consistent with member priorities not by performing studies at the request of one member unless they are part of a clearly defined and approved process like that for interconnections the iso should work as a market facilitator and as such expend its talents on providing accurate and timely pricing billing and tracking of energy transactions within into and out of new york the nyisos need to periodically address market reliability issues and to initiate studies should continue in the near term market participants can raise concerns about reliability issues or submit studies they perform to the iso and if the iso believes that they have merit we can all review and debate them and not be advantaged or disadvantaged by some activities that the iso decided to undertake with one member the iso should not pirate market participants opportunities to analyze the dynamics of generation availability transmission icap and demand to discover areas for investment what better stimulus than roi is there to seek out opportunities and eradicate inefficiencies in the market let the market work and the iso facilitate chad wagner dynegy
marketrelationsnyisocom writes to the nyisotechexchange discussion list dear market participants as many of you know and as some of you have commented about the iso performed additional computer analysis regarding locational icap requirements at nypas request early this year we did so after agreeing that the issue nypa raised was relevant to our market and would not detract from other work we were conducting the results were shared with nypa in march with the understanding that nypa would use the study results to promote a dialogue among market participants on the issues raised the nyiso would like to formalize the process of contract work on issues relevant to the new york market or decide to discontinue it by reviewing with market participants a proposed protocol indicating appropriate areas for study and appropriate disclosure guidelines we will request the operating business issues and management committee chairs to add this proposed protocol for discussion to committee agendas for may we look forward to working with all market participants on reaching agreement on an acceptable process that is both useful and fair to everyone regards mollie lampi nyiso senior attorney

mike id suggest we move on any decon work for our facilities at the same time the find of pcbs in the compressors will undoubtedly be the subject of next weeks meeting the presence of pcbs does not limit their use at that station pge would be reluctant to move the engines around on the system depending upon the concentrations at the time they may be restricted in their ability to sell or reuse the compressors im not aware of any true decon process for such equipment vector may be able to propose a piecemeal decon project but it would likely be expensive and involve the outage of the equipment for a significant period of time we might want to gather a group of folks and go over the agenda and our pososible response to a request by pge to take down thier compression

i spoke to john nystedt the contact person for the navajo nation fw service concerning the need to do endangered plants and animal surveys at the two cs on reservation lands i had sent to him the usgs quad sheets of the cs sites for review today he stated that he didnt think surveys would be needed at either location due to the fact that there had been historic disturbance at each location and that there was no sensitive habitiats in or near the cs sites which would warrant surveys however because of the issue of tribal lands he was going to discuss this issue with the navajo nation director and verify his opinion and he would let transwestern know on monday of next week as to what the tribes final decision would be but he was almost sure that the trib would recommend no surveys john has faxed to me the list of approved botonists and boilogists which are approved to do work on the reservation i have contacted a number of individuals on the list and they are prepared to do the boilogical surveys next week in the unlikely event a survey is required
based upon valving constraints and the innaccessability to the inside of the pipe between our ms and the topock cs a decision has been made to postpone cleaning of his section of the pipeline should cleaning occur of this section it is anticipated that it will not occur untill the installation of the filter separator at the pge cs sometime later this year vector has been notified of this change in plans and will adjust their cleaning schedule accordingly

guys i received harrells memo concerning the fuel use for the turbine and the fact that you had to reduce gas producer speeds to comply with the permits fuel use requirements my question is how does the fuel use compare with what solar says the fuel use should be if we can get solar to provide written guarantees and up the fuel use value for the turbine we can up the fuel value on the permit the state of colorado perceives increased fuel use beyond manufacturers values as the turbine not operating correctly and in need of mechanical adjustment from their eyes this would be a strong indication of excess emissions and i think there evaluation would hold some merit anyway i dont want to send up a red flag to the state of colorado would you contact solar and compare their fuel use values with what the monitors say the turbine is burning at la plata then let me know if worse gets to worse i may be able to use another tactic but only as a last resort

i am sending this notification to your department to seek a solution of halting and stopping inappropriate e mail materials which i am receiving i have been requested by louis soldano enron attorney for the gas pipeline group to apprise you of this situation the content of materials received i consider offensive and am sure it would also be considered objectionable and innappropriate by the standards of enron corporation please be advised that many times it is difficult to screen this material based upon the headings and titles that accompany the contents consequently innappropriate materials such as this are opened i have accidently opened two such e mails by mistake and have received the enron warning that my name and mailbox will be or may be audited in the future and that my name has been placed in a file because of this i am extremely uncomfortable about future accidents occuring and more importantly about the increased frequency and accessability of my e mail box to trash and questionable materials i would appreciate your immediate attention in this matter thank you very much

george dave cobrain of the nmed has verbally approved of the soil characterization work plan which you submitted to him for review and has said that we can begin work as soon as the plan is approved by the ocd i have not heard from bill olson of the ocd yet dave was going to inform the ocd that their office has given approval of the plan and that this might expidite bills review process ill let you know when i hear from the ocd
today i spoke with jean calhoun of the arizona chapter of the nature conservancy about the proposed sundevil pipeline construction project she was very cordial and appreciative concerning transwesterns proactive efforts to contact not only her office but all federal and state agencies which may have jurisdictional lands impacted by the project although the proposed route of the pipeline corridor has not been firmly established she did offer some general yet valuable information concerning the geographic area which exists south of flagstaff into roughly northern phoenix the area south of flagstaff into phoenix crosses of three major ecological regions identified by the tnc with major biological diversity of plants and animals the tnc has completed published studies on two of the regions the tnc has requested that should this project be apporved these publications be used to assist in the environmental studies which will need to be completed prior to construction and approval by ferc to the south and east of flagstaff is a sensitive portfolio consisting of the verde river which is of ecologic interest due to the abundance of endangered fish and bird species which live in and around the area of the river this river could be impacted by the pipeline due to its meandering in a southwesterly direction across arizona i have contacted other state and federal governmental agencies in addition to the tnc and all parties have expressed difficulity in assessing the environmental impact of a project of this magnitude without knowing the pipeline corridor route part of this concern is due to the extensive and unique biological diversity of arizona i think we will have a better handle on how we address the environmental concerns and opportunities when this piece of the puzzle is completed and also how much more specific and helpful the agencies assistance will be when identified areas are known

 the cruelty of age mildred and chester knew each other from childhood but were in their nineties when they got married they had to wait for mildreds mother to pass away first back in those days there was no hanky panky before marriage so chester and mildred were both still virgins needless to say chester was pretty excited on their wedding night having waited so patiently all these years however mildred was very apprehensive as she had developed a heart condition and would have to tell chester that they could not do it chester is now sitting on the bed wanting mildred to hurry up he detects a little reluctance on her part thinking that she is shy he sends her off to the bathroom to get undressed when she reappears in her silk sateen nightie he gets her to sit next to him on the bed not knowing how to get things started he pulls the first strap on her nightie she blushes just as red as her silk sateen nightie she is really concerned about telling chester about her heart condition in the meantime chester is looking at the first breast he has seen since his own mothers it is hanging there down to her belly button gravity having taken its course over some ninety years he realizes her anxiety but figures she is going have to be helped a little more now he pulls the second strap and sees the second breast unroll downward before him poor mildred is now beside herself she is going to have to tell chester about her heart with a quivering voice and mustering up all her courage she says chester i have acute angina chester says i sure hope so your tits look like hell

have fun and a safe thanksgiving richard bill clinton al gore and george w bush died and found themselves standing on the other side of the jordan river looking across at the promised land the archangel michael was standing on the other side and shouted over to the three surprised americans contrary to what you have been taught each of you will have to wade across the jordan river as michael saw their perplexed looks he reassured them by saying dont worry you will sink only proportionally according to your sins on earth the more you have sinned the more you will sink into the water the three american sages of political lore looked at one another trying to determine who shall be the first brave soul to cross the jordan river finally george w bush volunteered to go first slowly he began to wade out into the river and slowly the water began to get higher and higher reaching to his waist george began to sweat thinking all of his sins were coming back to haunt him he was beginning to wonder if he would ever see the other side finally after what seemed liked an eternity he began to emerge on the rivers bank as he ascended to the other side he looked behind him to see which one of the other brave souls was going next a shock of surprise registered on his face as he saw al gore almost in the middle of the river and only his ankles barely touching the water he turned to michael and exclaimed i know al gore al gore is a friend of mine and he has sinned much much more than that before the archangel michael could reply al gore shouted back im standing on clintons shoulders

lou i would like to confidentially discuss the issues larry has raised with you and see where the legal department may or may not want to proceed with these issues thanks john shafer
here are the latest and greatest
the following is a description and explanation of the violation that occurred at the la plata compressor station
guys i received harrells memo concerning the fuel use for the turbine and the fact that you had to reduce gas producer speeds to comply with the permits fuel use requirements my question is how does the fuel use compare with what solar says the fuel use should be if we can get solar to provide written guarantees and up the fuel use value for the turbine we can up the fuel value on the permit the state of colorado perceives increased fuel use beyond manufacturers values as the turbine not operating correctly and in need of mechanical adjustment from their eyes this would be a strong indication of excess emissions and i think there evaluation would hold some merit anyway i dont want to send up a red flag to the state of colorado would you contact solar and compare their fuel use values with what the monitors say the turbine is burning at la plata then let me know if worse gets to worse i may be able to use another tactic but only as a last resort

advisors presented below is a memo from gpg houston requesting that we provide to them the number of ets employees in each team who have taken advantage of the one year free membership with the nature conservancy apparently there is some concern that employees are not taking advantage of the opportunity which has been provided for them to get involved with an organization that has some benefit towards wildlife and habitat preservation and enhancement should an employee desire to sign up for the one year free memebership the conservancy the web address is wwwtncorg you can click the button that says become a member and sign up for the annual membership at that time at the request of mr john shafer please provide to me a total by team of the number of individuals which have signed up with the nature conservancy by the end of the month your assistance in this is greatly appreciated
today i spoke with jean calhoun of the arizona chapter of the nature conservancy about the proposed sundevil pipeline construction project she was very cordial and appreciative concerning transwesterns proactive efforts to contact not only her office but all federal and state agencies which may have jurisdictional lands impacted by the project although the proposed route of the pipeline corridor has not been firmly established she did offer some general yet valuable information concerning the geographic area which exists south of flagstaff into roughly northern phoenix the area south of flagstaff into phoenix crosses of three major ecological regions identified by the tnc with major biological diversity of plants and animals the tnc has completed published studies on two of the regions the tnc has requested that should this project be apporved these publications be used to assist in the environmental studies which will need to be completed prior to construction and approval by ferc to the south and east of flagstaff is a sensitive portfolio consisting of the verde river which is of ecologic interest due to the abundance of endangered fish and bird species which live in and around the area of the river this river could be impacted by the pipeline due to its meandering in a southwesterly direction across arizona i have contacted other state and federal governmental agencies in addition to the tnc and all parties have expressed difficulity in assessing the environmental impact of a project of this magnitude without knowing the pipeline corridor route part of this concern is due to the extensive and unique biological diversity of arizona i think we will have a better handle on how we address the environmental concerns and opportunities when this piece of the puzzle is completed and also how much more specific and helpful the agencies assistance will be when identified areas are known

have fun and a safe thanksgiving richard bill clinton al gore and george w bush died and found themselves standing on the other side of the jordan river looking across at the promised land the archangel michael was standing on the other side and shouted over to the three surprised americans contrary to what you have been taught each of you will have to wade across the jordan river as michael saw their perplexed looks he reassured them by saying dont worry you will sink only proportionally according to your sins on earth the more you have sinned the more you will sink into the water the three american sages of political lore looked at one another trying to determine who shall be the first brave soul to cross the jordan river finally george w bush volunteered to go first slowly he began to wade out into the river and slowly the water began to get higher and higher reaching to his waist george began to sweat thinking all of his sins were coming back to haunt him he was beginning to wonder if he would ever see the other side finally after what seemed liked an eternity he began to emerge on the rivers bank as he ascended to the other side he looked behind him to see which one of the other brave souls was going next a shock of surprise registered on his face as he saw al gore almost in the middle of the river and only his ankles barely touching the water he turned to michael and exclaimed i know al gore al gore is a friend of mine and he has sinned much much more than that before the archangel michael could reply al gore shouted back im standing on clintons shoulders

in an effort to protect enrons e mail system from harmful viruses the global messaging team has implemented an inbound and outbound cluster of mailsweeper servers what does that mean to you the user all inbound and outbound internet mail is passed through a set of servers that will scan each message for viruses malicious code business related content and inappropriate content inbound internet mail that contains the following attachment types will be quarantined held for delivery vbs exe com bat cmd if you are the intended recipient of one of these e mails you will receive an automatic notification with instructions on how to get your legitimate e mail released from quarantine we have taken these measures to protect our e mail environment from harmful e mail viruses we believe that these protections will result in less down time for your e mail in the event that enron gets hit with a virus or malicious code

chadjwagnerdynegycom writes to the nyisotechexchange discussion list this raises concerns about what functions any iso should take on in the long run here the iso used its limited resources ones which many members want directed to specific high priority projects such as virtual bidding to perform a study on icap that we did not know about until a flurry of emails arrive the point is the iso better serves by focusing its talent and limited time on facilitating the operation of a workable reliable cost effective and efficient power market and by performing studies consistent with member priorities not by performing studies at the request of one member unless they are part of a clearly defined and approved process like that for interconnections the iso should work as a market facilitator and as such expend its talents on providing accurate and timely pricing billing and tracking of energy transactions within into and out of new york the nyisos need to periodically address market reliability issues and to initiate studies should continue in the near term market participants can raise concerns about reliability issues or submit studies they perform to the iso and if the iso believes that they have merit we can all review and debate them and not be advantaged or disadvantaged by some activities that the iso decided to undertake with one member the iso should not pirate market participants opportunities to analyze the dynamics of generation availability transmission icap and demand to discover areas for investment what better stimulus than roi is there to seek out opportunities and eradicate inefficiencies in the market let the market work and the iso facilitate chad wagner dynegy

just a quick note on a statement stan horton made at a recent meeting with the ots group stan stated that the gpg was the foundation of the enron house and that it would be difficult for enron to keep its current bond rating without gpgs revenue
gentlemen take a look at what is going on in california this may or may not relate to how badly pge needs natural gas john
notice the sample results are much higher than last weeks sample at tw pge thanks randy
mike id suggest we move on any decon work for our facilities at the same time the find of pcbs in the compressors will undoubtedly be the subject of next weeks meeting the presence of pcbs does not limit their use at that station pge would be reluctant to move the engines around on the system depending upon the concentrations at the time they may be restricted in their ability to sell or reuse the compressors im not aware of any true decon process for such equipment vector may be able to propose a piecemeal decon project but it would likely be expensive and involve the outage of the equipment for a significant period of time we might want to gather a group of folks and go over the agenda and our pososible response to a request by pge to take down thier compression
based upon valving constraints and the innaccessability to the inside of the pipe between our ms and the topock cs a decision has been made to postpone cleaning of his section of the pipeline should cleaning occur of this section it is anticipated that it will not occur untill the installation of the filter separator at the pge cs sometime later this year vector has been notified of this change in plans and will adjust their cleaning schedule accordingly
based on the call from rod boschee today noting meetings set up with southwest lou and larry campbell will be attending i believe it would be helpful for dave schafer or a rep from communications to attend as well pge appears to be getting ready to divert attention to us worthwhile to read the pge media statement at the end of this lotus notes mike
just a short note to let you know that i received a call from rod bosche of pge apprising me of a meeting pge will be having with sw gas this tuesday they will be discussing pcb issues and the sampling results from the pge system from discussions with louie a media statement is being prepared by them which louie has a copy of the statement is a little harsh and makes some statements which are incorrect louie and i are planning to attend this meeting in las vegas to possibly assist in making some suggestions about rewording their statement and provide some additional insight and history on the transwestern system with respect to pcbs the results of this meeting will be forwarded at a later date
on tuesday of this week lou soldano and i attended a meeting between the above referenced parties concerning the issue of pcbs which had migrated into the pge system southwest gas is a customer of pges and recieves natural gas from pge for delivery to its customers pge has prepared a media statement which it is going to be sent out to those parties which receive gas from interconnects testing positive for pcbs as of today only the customer base around needles california will see the pge statement the two issues of note first transwestern was able to make some minor changes to the media statement to more clearly show in the statement that this release of pcbs was an isolated incident and that all parties are diligently incorporating measures to contain and manage this release a copy of the revised media statement is available upon request from louie or myself second pge and southwest gas have jointly agreed to conduct immediate sampling activities at downstream interconnect locations on the southwest gas system to determine if the pcbs have spread into parts of their system results of this sampling will be presented in a meeting tentatively scheduled in a couple of weeks transwestern will probably atttend this meeting

larry thank you for sending me a copy of the mou between you and nwtf the rmef while interested in working with you will need more substance behind the partnership and how we intended to work together im up to my neck in a restructuring process through the end of the month or i would offer some recommendations if you would like to take a crack at a draft mou with specific details associated with the partnership i would be happy to review another draft in november i should have a bit more time to spend on this opportunity if you are simply looking for a local partnership to work on projects i will steer you to alan or one of our local staff members in the region again thank you for the interest and i look forward to working with you on a mutually beneficial partnership dan

on behalf of eott an environmental records review was completed for a block of koch crude oil pipeline assets located in south texas there were no issues or environmental deficiencies identified during the review a due diligence was recommended to verify confirmation of the housekeeping activities presented in the records review the air permit modification for the la plata cs was received from the state of colorado this modification allows for additional emissions and fuel use as a result of a change in gas quality supplies in the san juan basin
scott i have sent out twice a request to each of the field teams in the midland region to provide some desperately needed tank information to determine compliance for all the eott crude oil tanks in the midland area so far only the midland lovington kermit andrews hobbs and jal teams have responded i would appreciate your assistance in motivating the remaining seven teams to get this information to me at their earliest convenience i have attached the most recent update of the tank spreadsheet for you to pass on to the teams thanks for the help
bill you may want to sit in on this if you have time it seems we have items of concern that were identified during the consolidated audit at bakersfield which were tied into a previous agreement with koch for which the action team did not know when the action items were prepared the action dates are approaching and scott and i are having a hard time getting clearification on how to initiate getting the the action items started due to the responsibility of koch for some of the items ed the attorney for eott will be requested by lou to notify koch concerning their responsiblity if this sounds convoluted then you know as much as i
bob james roger im having a hard time getting a response from the teams in the midland region in completing the attached eott tank spreadsheet ive heard from some of the teams but nothing from others im under the gun as to finding out where the midland region is in term of permits and and environmental compliance and the only way i can begin to make the evaluation is to have the field data inputed onto the spreadsheet this is where the teams assistance is required i have attached the latest version of the spreadsheet in the hope that you will deliver it to the following teams for their valued input monahans team hamlinhaskel team lamesa team big lake team midland team eunice team your assistance in this will be greatly appreciated
randy i need your assistance with something im trying to determine compliance for all the eott crude oil storage tanks in the midland region bill told me that you have a spreadsheet of the eott tanks showing some of the tank characteristics size storage date of installation state etc whatever you have i would greatly appreciate your shaing it with me e mail works best for me thanks again if you send this to me i promise to let you out fish me like you did in minnesota a couple of years ago

kevin as promised attached is the information that was found by david roensch on environemntal perspectives in the flagstaff area
george dave cobrain of the nmed has verbally approved of the soil characterization work plan which you submitted to him for review and has said that we can begin work as soon as the plan is approved by the ocd i have not heard from bill olson of the ocd yet dave was going to inform the ocd that their office has given approval of the plan and that this might expidite bills review process ill let you know when i hear from the ocd
today i spoke with jean calhoun of the arizona chapter of the nature conservancy about the proposed sundevil pipeline construction project she was very cordial and appreciative concerning transwesterns proactive efforts to contact not only her office but all federal and state agencies which may have jurisdictional lands impacted by the project although the proposed route of the pipeline corridor has not been firmly established she did offer some general yet valuable information concerning the geographic area which exists south of flagstaff into roughly northern phoenix the area south of flagstaff into phoenix crosses of three major ecological regions identified by the tnc with major biological diversity of plants and animals the tnc has completed published studies on two of the regions the tnc has requested that should this project be apporved these publications be used to assist in the environmental studies which will need to be completed prior to construction and approval by ferc to the south and east of flagstaff is a sensitive portfolio consisting of the verde river which is of ecologic interest due to the abundance of endangered fish and bird species which live in and around the area of the river this river could be impacted by the pipeline due to its meandering in a southwesterly direction across arizona i have contacted other state and federal governmental agencies in addition to the tnc and all parties have expressed difficulity in assessing the environmental impact of a project of this magnitude without knowing the pipeline corridor route part of this concern is due to the extensive and unique biological diversity of arizona i think we will have a better handle on how we address the environmental concerns and opportunities when this piece of the puzzle is completed and also how much more specific and helpful the agencies assistance will be when identified areas are known
dan sorry about taking so long it getting back to you about this but i had a couple of crises i had to address im still realing from the impact i have attached for your review the agreement which we are in the process of finalizing with the wild turkey federation take a look at the document and let me know what you think after your review we can make the necessary changes and modifications i have been advised by our legal department that each of the three major pipelines owned and operated by enron will need a separate contract with the rmef so what we decide for transwestern will undoubtably work for the others thanks for your patience in this

im free all day give me a time
kj
i think its time that we did a maintenace spot check on the white units at the above referenced facility to stay in line with the operating conditions of the facility permit it would probably be a good idea to check on the emissions status of the whites at the same time

i would be honored do we meet there or somewhere else

just a short note to let you know that i received a call from rod bosche of pge apprising me of a meeting pge will be having with sw gas this tuesday they will be discussing pcb issues and the sampling results from the pge system from discussions with louie a media statement is being prepared by them which louie has a copy of the statement is a little harsh and makes some statements which are incorrect louie and i are planning to attend this meeting in las vegas to possibly assist in making some suggestions about rewording their statement and provide some additional insight and history on the transwestern system with respect to pcbs the results of this meeting will be forwarded at a later date
i do not know this person i think you have the wrong larry campbell
your resume is good enough bc i gave it directly to the hiring people
don baughman and juan hernandez if the listing you saw says edwin coulter he no longer is part of the group lc
based upon valving constraints and the innaccessability to the inside of the pipe between our ms and the topock cs a decision has been made to postpone cleaning of his section of the pipeline should cleaning occur of this section it is anticipated that it will not occur untill the installation of the filter separator at the pge cs sometime later this year vector has been notified of this change in plans and will adjust their cleaning schedule accordingly
rich this is the public notice for the groundwater remediation at the tw north crawar facility because we are emitting emissions to the air from the contamination in the groundwater we had to have a permit
guys i received harrells memo concerning the fuel use for the turbine and the fact that you had to reduce gas producer speeds to comply with the permits fuel use requirements my question is how does the fuel use compare with what solar says the fuel use should be if we can get solar to provide written guarantees and up the fuel use value for the turbine we can up the fuel value on the permit the state of colorado perceives increased fuel use beyond manufacturers values as the turbine not operating correctly and in need of mechanical adjustment from their eyes this would be a strong indication of excess emissions and i think there evaluation would hold some merit anyway i dont want to send up a red flag to the state of colorado would you contact solar and compare their fuel use values with what the monitors say the turbine is burning at la plata then let me know if worse gets to worse i may be able to use another tactic but only as a last resort
i received word from the tnrcc that they will allow a portable emissions test at the spraberry cs to confirm that the replacement of the fuel mixers with carbureators will not cause an increase in emissions i will send out the letter today to the tnrcc reqesting written approval to do the testing i would strongly recommend that the spraberry team have the sampling ports installed on the unit that they select to be tested and have this testing completed asap remember the unit selected must be tested with the fuel mixer on and then remove the mixer and conduct a test with the carbureator on whoever performs the portable emissions testing will need to ensure that we follow a portocol that i will submit to the state
george ive read through your stuff on the gomez remediation and need some help why are we collecting so much groundwater im concerned that charges for twice weekly disposal may be perceived as excessive even though the costs are reasonable are we trying to dewater or what other than that i dont mind ensuring the protection of the upstream spring and think we should get busy on the well installations do you think this will do it with respect to no more wells needed id like to get to that position as quickly as possible
this is a short note to apprise those that the before and after emissions testing for the fuel valves and carbuerator at the spraberry cs has been submitted to t he tnrcc the data showed fuel savings as we had hoped it would and we also received an emissions reduction benefit according to the agency this replacement activity will not require an amendment to the permit which will be a plus for the company my compliments to all involved for the retesting and efforts it took to make this happen i will forward the response from the tnrcc as it is received
see attached save for thursday
john lou cutty bill i want to bring this issue back up for your attention as i know that everyone is very busy during the epa title v inspection at the laguna cs this past week barbara bernacek the laguna environmental person was present she had been asked to be there by the epa during our tour of the facility she casually asked if any progress or decision had been made by enron management towards remediation assistance in the groundwater issue at the laguna cs i had informed her that we were still actively discussing this issue and would contact her in the near future concerning managements decision i would appreciate it very much if each of you would revisit my memo below and then lets discuss what should be done and the approach we should take in addressing the lagunas concern about a proactive approach to reaching cleanup and closure
rich thanx for the sampling update ill pass it along to the apropriate parties a cursory look at the data shows it to be inconsistently up and down as expected with no glaring increases anything urgent we need to discuss
you may have an interest in learning more about this product if not that is also fine john

prc reporting
here are details on one search firm for legal thanks mhc
each data protection supervisory authority can be contacted some may review we are not aware of one supervisory authority that can bind all authorities in all states with its approval of a contract but if you are not required by law to pre submit your contract i question whether you want to do so you may get multiple interpretations we believe that you should develop your best judgment about whether your documents conform to the legal requirements and submit the contract where you are required to do so not seek advice from the regulatory authorities about the specifics of your contracts after all as we indicated this area of the law is still in flux and we would hate to see you lock into a position with an authority unless you absolutely had to do so

michelle fortunately we have already received some advice on the effects of bankruptcy on noxtech from our patent counsel which is attached this is very promising and appears to put us very much in control of the intellectual property turning to the employment of the key individual bruce sudduth you will see from the covering email that we might want to take some immediate steps to preserve our ability to access him in the event bankruptcy is declared however i am not convinced on the limited amount of information that we would not be running the risk of a tortious interference claim unless we agreed it with the directors of noxtech first and then proposed it to bruce what do you think marcus

each data protection supervisory authority can be contacted some may review we are not aware of one supervisory authority that can bind all authorities in all states with its approval of a contract but if you are not required by law to pre submit your contract i question whether you want to do so you may get multiple interpretations we believe that you should develop your best judgment about whether your documents conform to the legal requirements and submit the contract where you are required to do so not seek advice from the regulatory authorities about the specifics of your contracts after all as we indicated this area of the law is still in flux and we would hate to see you lock into a position with an authority unless you absolutely had to do so
michelle i have an employee that wants out of his employment agreement he feels it was a mistake to sign it he is starting into his second year of the contract what are our options in this case hes willing to give up all the options given him and any future payments i promised him i wouldnt share his name with anyone gary

lizzette the fact that we specifically elected at the outset of our green card process to proceed down the consular route was to ensure that notwithstanding the inconvenience of traveling to the uk at relatively short notice the benefit would be that we would stand a better chance if we were to receive a green card of receiving one in the shortest possible period of time i currently have little confidence in tindall foster to be able to deliver on anything now that we are forced to parallel process with the adjusted status route we need to be clear on this this is not and never was our preferred route unless there is something that provides me with significant comfort that the consular route is an avenue that we are able to pursue in a timely manner i would like to re visit employing tindall foster and would like to consider a firm in either new york or london regards marcus

michelle our group has been asked by eel liz barrett to deploy the attachment survey we hrgim would like to ensure the language of the survey is consistent with the policies and procedures of enron corp legal jon chapman has reviewed the document any insight you can provide is appreciated regards milton ps liz barretts comments are below regarding the rationale behind the ethnic descriptions in the survey i worked with jon chapman on the survey so it has been comprehensively done over by legal the reason why ive chosen these categories are that they are the accepted categorisations by the commission for racial equality who are the governing body on race relations in the uk and are aligned to their counter parts in europe if we do have a legal challenge we will be asked to provide data in this fomat rather than the us descriptors which are not as relevant to the european ethnic profile for instance hispanic is not a meaningful category for europe whereas it is very significant for the us id prefer to map the us definitions onto the european ones but to collect the european data in the cres format

would you mind checking into something for me one of our lawyers was called by someone from industrial markets who was laid off he indicated that he had an employment contract that has a six month non compete for involuntary termination he said that he called hr to get a waiver of the non compete so that he could pursue new employment and was told that no waiver would be granted is that our policy or are these issues being addressed on a case by case basis i find it hard to believe that we would even think about enforcing a non compete for someone weve laid off so why not grant the waiver if this is not the policy we need to get this straightened out

david late last week i received a call from kristen kracraft who does employment law at dynegy she indicated that they would like for there to be a protocol for how to handle things if there is a desire to allow the hiring of employees from dynegy to enron or vice versa of course such hiring would have to be coordinated at the top of the company to avoid any type of free for all at a minimum i would think that you and andrea lang would have to be the ones who make the decisions with that thought i have asked tim orourkes team to work on such a protocol in the meantime kristen mentioned that one person in rick shapiros group wants to go to dynegy she understood that shapiro had said it was ok do you know about that if not should you give andrea a call about it i am concerned about the floodgate effect so i believe we should proceed with extreme caution let me know your thoughts on this michelle

trade press recruiting firms and others recently have made numerous calls to enron employees seeking information about the company its employees and other matters in some cases these callers have used false identities as in im from the sec and i need you to provide me with if you receive a call from someone identifying themselves as part of a government organization please refer the caller to the legal department please refer calls from the trade press and other media inquiries to the public relations group and otherwise please treat enron information as confidential thank you
as i suggested earlier it appears that abitibi has no response to boises move to reduce or eliminate its purchase of slush pulp from abitibis fort frances on mill right now it appears abitibi will allow the pulp line at ff to go down when boise stops purchasing from the mill this may create an opportunity for us to finance installation of a pulp dryer at ff in return for offtake although i suspect the competitive cost position of the ff pulp line probably would make it a better strategy for us to focus our efforts on st felicien also i dont know that abitibi would be interested in a pulp dryer at ff dave

martin subsequent to my last e mail i discovered an additional detail which may po ssibly clarify why ence prefers to purchase the chilean e globulus species to the brazilian species for pulp production it would appear that the e globulus species holds up better than the various brazilian species during the refining process while most papermakers generally dont refine hardw oods and softwoods with the same equipment many smaller european mills are unable to afford the capital investment of a second refiner and accordingl y do use a single refiner for all grades this is particularly true of the italian mills since hardwoods cannot withstand the rigorous refining req uired for softwoods without losing their papermaking characteristics opaci ty etc these papermakers need to utilize the hardwood species best suit ed for this type of processing accordingly the globulus species which i s also the predominant species in the iberian peninsula holds up much bett er under this type of heavy refining than any other species of eucalyptus in any case i hope this helps shed additional light on this issue and as always please feel free to revert with any questions you might have tha nks karen

today was a very difficult day for us as market uncertainty continued recent news reports including the wall street journal article today have speculated about possible mergers takeovers and equity investors as options that enron is considering the reason you have not seen us responding to these reports is that it is our corporate policy not to comment on market speculation however i will tell you that we are evaluating all options to protect the financial stability of this company i will keep you updated on developments as they occur
monika per our discussion please see the attached kc
enron and dynegy each announced today that they are holding discussions about a possible merger of the two companies as you know dynegy is a major player in the energy marketplace and is not only a competitor but also a counterparty of enron this is just one of several options that we are considering upon receipt of this announcement the nyse briefly suspended trading of both enron and dynegy we have no additional information we can share at this time well keep you updated as developments occur

monika please find the final market wrap attached thanks kc
after several very difficult weeks enron announced on friday that the company has reached an agreement to merge with dynegy i know that everyone has many questions right now regarding the future of the associate analyst program we are working as quickly as possible with the business units and executive management to determine the future course of the program as the merger points on the enron homepage indicate httphomeenroncom dynegy has a similar program called pace and the two companies will consider a combination of the two programs today all of the business units within enron will be holding floor meetings to discuss the pending merger and its implications for enron i encourage each of you to participate in one of these meetings the announcement of the deal with dynegy marks a significant event in removing some of the uncertainties weve all dealt with over the past several weeks as decisions are made regarding the future of the company and specific business units we will be able to determine and communicate the future of the program new opportunities will be created from the changes that are occurring the very best talent from both organizations will rise to the top and our associates and analysts will be a key part of our future success i appreciate your continued efforts and patience during this difficult time billy lemmons vice president associate analyst program

randy lord with building maintenance advised us that hlp had a switch problem that caused the enron building to lose all commercial power the ups systems switched to the auxillary generators and there was minimal impact to the computer rooms and gas control center during the outage the backup chiller on the roof did not kick in automatically and building maintenance performed the switch manually the computer rooms warmed up a bit but not enough to be a problem they plan to bring contractors in tomorrow morning to determine what the problem was with the backup chiller the gas logistics business systems did lose one server but there was minimal to no business impact gas control was not impacted we will check with randy tomorrow morning to see if hlp has determined the root cause of their equipment failure let us know if you have any questions or concerns gary kenagy and scott abshire

shelley what do you think beez since our telephone conversation concerning the special sprc meeting i have prayedthought about the topic and have the following opinion while i agree that this decision has to be made with the good of the entire congregation in mind i would like to say that my family and i feel our personal needs are being met by ernie and the example he provides we have witnessed ernie handle delicate situations with compassion and consideration we also appreciate ernies support during alinas difficult transition at acec we feel that while ernies sermons may be hard to follow at times and that he is not the most outgoing person we never have questioned his sincerity or dedication for this church having said this we realize that we dont have the day to day contact with ernie that seems to be a component of the problem furthermore i dont believe we can afford to have aumcs membership adversely affected if this church is to be the kind of church we hope it will be therefore i guess my official position is that ernie has my familys support but aumc is our home and whatever is best for aumc that is the direction we should take kim

an action item coming out of our tour and discussion at the hangar on wednesday was for the two of you to discuss what offsite testing activities we need to pursue this year on the table are the annual technical test and the business test for the omaha offsite and a drill for the new interim offsite at the hangar we generally start preparation for the technical test several months in advance and it is a fairly significant effort for both the gas control and business systems i do feel strongly that we need to complete a technical test of the omaha offsite it is important for business continuity but probably more important to insure that we have a stable and fully configured production environment prior to beginning any activities to split out nng or move out of the enron building let me know how to proceed thanks gary

heather will try to get you the stuff you want fyi if you tell us in advance of the meeting we can be sure to get the draft orders for you in the escutia room we do not generally get all the orders unless an attorney or client has indicated an interest in the item so when we get close to a commission meeting give us or heather a buzz and ask for what you are tracking mike
my recollection is that this sheet is a bit vague on detail californias gas problems are twofold wellhead prices are still high cera is the best place to get more data on drilling activity etc instate capacity is tigh in pge and sdge cec did a study no in any event california utiilties probably have plans to eliminate the bottlenecks gac
hey calger told me that skilling said that the pgesierra deals pretty much kapoot does that mean that youre finally freed from that hairball
do we really not know who is speaking on our behalf at the event in la
if there is going to be a play come the first of the year to meld californias px and iso skilling may want to consider pre empting that agenda and most of this is not new already included in previous messaging points weve developed internally its the gas industry stupid for profit transcos is the answer californias big mistake was replacing one monopoly the utility with another the px pxs are not necessarily bad things but pxs with a monopoly is a very bad thing forcing the ious to buy everything from the px was irresponsible put everyone on a variable rate mortgage story decision makers openly admitted that they put in place a strucuture designed not to encourage retail choice and competition decision makers actively urged families and businesses not to switch to providers offering an insurance policy ie fixed price deals against the volatile and risky power exchange price when you combine the supply shortage the px monopoly the nonexistant retail market and decision makers attempts to discourage choice you get a debacle thats what california set itself up for and thats what it got putting the px inside the iso will only infect the wound thats already been inflicted the real answer isweve developed these points already this is quick and dirty and can be made much more punchy and articulate but wanted to get the notion out there given our time constraints best jeff

dynegy enron a model competitor it doesnt happen very often so were noting an apparently spontaneous comment from dynegy counsel ed ross at a ferc roundtable last week that one of his chief competitors enron has done an excellent job of being competitive he suggested others could look to enron as a model competitor theyve done a very good job of setting up a strong financial desk and a strong physical desk and we dont see any problem with it i think they have set up their books in a way that they truly have separation between the regulated and unregulated aspects of their business ross had prefaced the remark midway through a heated debate on affiliate abuses with the comment that this is not an industry wide problem i believe there are good and bad players in the market today earlier enrons leslie lawner had invited all of you to spend the day on enrons trading floor because i assure you you will not see a more competitive environment anywhere there is no way these folks who fight like cats and dogs among themselves would voluntarily transfer value to the pipeline group for the good of the bottom line lawner had to quickly back off the invitation mentioning confidentiality restrictions when it appeared about half the room was ready to troop over to the trading floor

heres an attempt at being frank about the legislation without jeopardizing our relationships or commercial prospects overall we respect the effort but california failed to get the ball over the goal line on siting intentionally or not california has designed power plant siting laws that make it excruciatingly difficult to construct power plants in the state folks seem to have lost sight of the need to balance growth and environmental quality in california thats why nothings been built in the state for a decade and developers are going outside the state to build power plants tinkering around the edges wont help and with all due respect the legislation passed yesterday tinkers real reform is required if california hopes to build the supply necessary to keep pace with silicon valley and a high tech culture and tame the price spikes if developers continue to have to navigate through a maze of a half a dozen or more state and local agencies californias supply problems will continue or worsen california needs real one stop shopping and it needs it now on the retail price cap they dont work weve already developed all the arguments so i wont repeat them hear the press has already reported that the measure the legislature passed simply puts off the day of reckoning its like using your credit card eventually theyre going to knock on your door to collect now families and businesses will have a hard time managing their budgets because they cant gauge the size of the balloon payment theyll face a couple of years down the road so san diegans who continue to take service from sdge will pay the same amount but the cap will remove the powerful incentive prices create to use electricity wisely theres a better answer instead of urging consumers not to switch encourage customers to sign with another retail provider clearly the biggest mistake california made was the press and decision makers should spend more time talking to folks who signed fixed price deals with companies like enron but for the press reports they hardly know theres a crisis
thanks

class on thursday something that we can talk about in mexico
im here
some thoughts on the conference best jeff
confidential draft not for release
i spoke with abag attorney kenneth moy and aps attorney dan douglas neither was thrilled with the woodbarnett draw but neither was immediately warm to the notion of a negotiated continuance i outlined the arguments against charging into the guns of wood and barnett and reminded them that there could very likely be delays anyway as a result of the cpucs continued indecision about the end of the rate freeze which looks to be increasing as a result of the administrations deadlock with the utilities they both indicated that they would discuss the matter with their clients and get back to us shortly i suspect at least one of them will say no we want to go ahead even if you do not as soon as i hear from them i will contact sce and pge mike day
jimjeff here is our response to sdge i will keep you posted on the process we are going to try to get a deal done without leaving our price open c
see highlighted portion we should throw this back at davis next time he points the finger the controllers criticism of fellow democrat davis won support from assembly republicans and secretary of state bill jones a republican considering challenging davis next year jones said he wants to announce his own plan to solve the states energy woes but cant unless davis releases more financial details he said his plan may involve giving the utilities low interest loans with their transmission lines held as collateral davis spokesman steve maviglio dismissed the criticism political grandstanding doesnt generate one more kilowatt of energy for california in this time of emergency he said maviglio said the administration has released the financial information it can without jeopardizing negotiations for long term power contracts with wholesalers associated press 
since the siting legislation created only a program that is voluntary and not in place of the existing laws and we have a committment from the legislature the cec and the govenors office to take another shot in january as they know that this legislation is flawed too many conflicting interests trying to solve a complex problem in too short a time i feel this is too harshwe have already started the process of creating new legislation that will be as close to a consensus as possible for next sessionthis legislation did not hurt us and some companies feel that they can use the processes we have to keep in mind that with the knowledge that there will be major reorganization legislation next year we dont want to offend the friends that we have in sacramento particularly the republicans who were the ones who insisted on an expedited siting bill

could you please see if you can get a copy electronic preferably of this greatly appreciated
its unfortunate that the states largest utility was forced to turn to the courts for a resolution solutions to the states energy crisis have been available for months that would have avoided this scenario but gov davis and the legislature lacked the bold leadership to take swift decisive action enrons exposure to pge will not have any material effect on earnings or on our financial condition if pressed any further comment would be speculative as we have not yet seen the filing
deadline is monday for the story

hi darlin thanks again for everything last night all kidding aside i wish you all the best with your procedure tomorrow ill be sending lots of positives vibes your way all day and im sure well be up to see you this weekend best jeff
here is what we know so far with the recent announcement of a deal between socal and the state for the transmission lines the deal may be enough to save socal from bankruptcy this will depend on the payment terms as well as how soon socal can receive a positive cash flow we are not sure if the state can really do a deal without pge or a deal for whole grid it was thought that a transmission asset deal was not possible without pge this may still be the case the state may still be making the deal contingent upon the purchasing of pges assets a generator source reports that the state is intending to put pressure on the bankruptcy court to close the deal on pges lines quickly however bankruptcy courts usually do not operate in this manner in most cases the court would have to hold open proceedings have competitive bids etc this purchase would need legislative approval which is not guaranteed previously the plan was for the state to purchase sces and pges assets at a premium so that they would not have to finance power purchases the utilities would be able to buy power for themselves now they would have to purchase sces lines but still finance power purchases because of pge additionally it is possible that socal swapped the clause allowing then to raise rates in order to recoup past debt in favor for an additional book price if this any form of a utility bailout it would probably no gain legislative approval the purchase would also need ferc approval as stated before if ferc approves such a plan it would be with several conditions for california
no duplication with both of us trying to dig up a copy were sure to find one best jeff
fyi todays update
dear energy committee member i just spoke with two of governor davis top energy advisors as you know the governor mentioned the need for a rate increase in his televised address last thursday night while his speech and corresponding notes went into some detail on how that increase would impact residential customers it did not go into great detail on the increase to commercial customers as you know the pucs proposed increase was not at all proportional relative to use by residential and commercial customers and the corresponding rate increase for each svmg has long argued that some level of increase would probably be necessary but that any rate increase should be proportional to use for instance since residents use approximately one third of the power then residential customers should absorb one third of the increase taking into account of course the most vulnerable residents and commercial customers should absorb the two thirds in a way that is proportional to use i am encouraged by my phone call with the governors advisors in that they seemed to agree strongly that the puc proposal was not at all proportional and seemed to concur that such a disproportional structure would be damaging to california employers they are going to send me more details tomorrow tuesday about the governors plan and i will then pass that information along in the meantime i hope this limited information helps and will keep you posted as i learn more sincerely carl guardino winmaildat
httpwwwedisoninvestorcomfinancialexcscemoupdf
what was the point of that statement it sure seemed like a non statement
 pge statement below they say they will continue with the bankruptcy court to resolve their situation i heard on npr this morning trying to get the transcript right now that if pge doesnt sell their transmission system to the state it will cause sce and sdge to go bankrupt as wellagain im trying to verify thatim not whole heartedly trusting my early morning listening skills

cant wait to meet the little bundle of joy
last week i distributed a presentation that the brattle group gave before the california inquisition ie legislative gas oversight committee looking into the gas price spikes at the cal border the brattle group is a consulting firm that edison has long used to beat up on socalgas recall that edison used to be a big gas customer when it owned power plants edison arranged for the brattle group to be the star witness at the cal leg gas hearing their job was to set up el paso and dynegy for the hit at hearings that took place the following day their message was simple and simplistic el paso and dynegy have market power they have used the market power to drive up basis and thus the price of gas at the border to obscene levels that in turn has driven up electricity prices ken lay is giving a gas talk tomorrow and rob bradley asked that i provide the alternative view to the edisonbrattle rant in the event that he gets any questions on the topic its attached apologies its quick and dirty but it provides the basics obviously no need for us to defend el paso or dynegy but might be useful to offer a more rationale explanation than the one that the california legislature is peddling finally we were also fingered somewhat as culprits at the hearing the california puc ferc lawyer claimed that ena and tw colluded to drive up basis when ena controlled a portion of the capacity but the overriding goal of the hearing was to go after ep and dynegy best jeff

two of the three commission hired witnesses testified today peter bradford and george sterzinger while bradford did nothing to really help or hurt our cause sterzinger was amazingly helpful he practically endorsed enrons proposal he noted that it was the best design to elicit strong conservation response by as he put it grabbing hold of some of the usage and making it responsive to the manipulation of the market the idea was that customers would respond to the high prices which are the product of market manipulation by reducing usage he focused alot on the decremenatal usage credit and the incentive it would provide to conserve he proposed an alternative manner of funding in that the rebate would be flowed back to customers as a bill reduction over an extended period of time he also noted that he would implement the proposal as a voluntary one at least initially as to the other parties proposals on cross he expressed strong concerns about shifting usage from peak to should peak as that does nothing but shift the peak period and stressed that the commission should carefully examine any rate design which would have the potential to do such he also testified that of the two forms of conservation being discussed in this proceeding load shifting or load reduction the latter was far more important and that the goal should be to lower energy usage at all times all in all not a bad afternoon for our proposal his testimony appears to have renewed interest in what was beginning to look like a nonstarter tomorrow the remaining commission witness bornstein is up followed by bill marcus for turn and pge witness coyne the billing constraint witnesses are up thursday the hearing should conclude by noon on thursday with briefs due noon on monday jeanne bennett

one minor edit its the px not the iso thats taken itself into voluntary bankruptcy see redline version attached only other comment im not sure that technicallycontractually we entered into transactions with the px in the same way that i dont think that folks enter into transactions with nymex see opening line of last paragraph we have exposure to thepx based on our commercial activity that took place through the px and that exposure depends on how the px ferc decide particular issues in short we have transactions with the utilities and exposure to the px based on transactions that we entered into with other counter parties via the px market mechanism that said seems to me that for the purposes of the disclosure the language is fine just want to raise the flag might be useful to run it by richard sanders hope this helps best jeff

the north american electric reliability council nerc asks house speaker to act on electric reliability nerc has written a letter to speaker of the house dennis hastert urging his support for passage of legislation this congressional session to promote reliability of the electric power grid anger over pricey power in san diego key to house race the soaring bills for electricity that have been showing up in the mail boxes of southern californians are expected to influence the november ballot boxes in a tight race that pits republican representative brian bilbray against a democratic challenger nh electric deregulation clears last major hurdle the three year battle over the restructuring of public service co of new hampshire has cleared its last major hurdle with regulatory approval of a state law but a few potential stumbling blocks remain officials said in tallahassee fla the way electricity is generated and delivered to homes and businesses is likely to be vastly different in a decade a panel on wednesday began to decide how different by developing a statewide energy policyone of the most controversial issues is likely to be the prospect of deregulation and out of state power companies that want to challenge the local monopolies of the states investor owned utilities a california power emergency escalated on wednesday with some industrial and commercial customers cut off as scorching temperatures boosted demand and fires threatened three major transmission lines springville utah city officials again face angry power customers the city council will meet at tuesday evening to talk about payment options and again try to help residents understand why they are receiving high utility bills

a couple of folks have told me that sdge wants to go to the commission to get a pre prudency type approval with the cpuc prior to moving forward with any type of deal that seamed odd to me and they would need to have a deal in hand or have some parameters of a deal structure to get any type of approval i imagine that sdge is concerned that the shareholders get stuck with any risk if the do enter into a deal and it is found not to be prudent not to mention the fact that they have had trouble pulling a trigger or even pointing in the past have any of the other utilities tried something like this or does the cpuc give a pre approval or a declaratory order of this nature does the cpuc have process in place to do this any thoughts

attached is a draft response to the economics arguments made by the electricity oversight board please let me know if you have any problems with these these arguments need a little wordsmithing but they are sound
what polluting enron plant is he speaking of
is ees or ena planning to attend the isos vendor fair and stakeholder meeting mentioned below gov affairs was not planning on it unless one of you need us to go and well see if we can fit it in as you can see one of our cusomters is asking about it
the cpuc can do it it it wants its a decision about risk and reward if the cpuc wants to set up a mechanism by which pre approval is permitted it can do so heres the catch pre approval means that the iou has to be willing generally to accept a bit more risk they dont like that the cpuc has to be willing to relinquish a bit of control this commission definitely doesnt like that idea so often the utility puts up a proposal that the commission says places to much risk with granny the cpuc often issues a decision in response that the utility claims leaves to much control read second guessing with the commission and therefore leaves to much risk with the utility in the end the utility often declines the commissions offer however it can be done for example under californias restructuring law the utilitys purchases from the px are just and reasonable period of course we see where the incentive built into that mechanism got us a debacle do you have pges and edisons proposals filed regarding bilaterals some weeks ago in which they propose certain pre approval mechanisms the commission didnt adopt them wholesale and the decision has made pge and edison reticent to sign any such as a result witness the unfruitful rfps this at all helpful
fyi in case youre interested
due to the absence of any large consumer presence in the grc i had asked phyllis if we might be able to encourage the meug group to do something to support the proposed decision ie letter to the commission meetings w the commissioners press saying high rates are bad ive put together a summary which is a first draft and wordy but would appreciate comments on making it snappy this is for internal distribution and comment at this point let me know your thoughts asap thanks
thanks
fyi
were in the process of developing a strategy to take us through the next few months but while the otherwise perishable thoughts are still fresh in my mind from the hearings on monday and tuesday i wanted to throw out some observations for discussion in the daysweeks ahead observation the pressure to finger somebody for price gouging is increasing the administration is hell bent on finding a fall guy the price spikes pose real political risks for davis and he and his folks need and want an easy way out his press release following the hearing renewed the call for refunds on my panel loretta lynch asked reliant and duke to supply her with the details of the contracts they cut to sell their power forward to marketers and carl woods remarks were extreme at the barton hearing a liberal democrat filner and a conservative republican hunter locked arms in calling for refunds bilbray joined the gouging band wagon the utilities repeatedly called on ferc to do a real investigation with hearings testimony data discovery the works on the positive side the ferc commissioners lauded wolak his analysis and his remarks on the panel wolak said somewhat emphatically that the nature of californias market structure makes it impossible to single out a single participant as the culprit he also stated that just everyones just acting in their own self interest responding to the screwed incentives embedded in the structure implication it seems prudent for enron to understand better its risks of getting fingered in the best case the clamoring for a refund subsides in which case the only cost to enron is the internal cost incurred to understand better the risks of getting fingered in the medium case investigations find that enron like others played by the rules but the rules stunk and enron profited at the expense of california consumers
the commission has opened an investigation which we are still awaiting some indication about its scope however it is likely to ask questions about how we can fix californias retail markets contained below are some questions that a coalition that we participate in has formulated i would like to start developing our position relative to those questions ie default provider what product should the utility offer etc i am happy to take a first stab at responses to the following and circulate for comment to get things started in the meantime if anyone has any thoughts about these questions it would be appreciated thanks mona
first let me thank all of you who have been drafted into the enron communications army communications is rapidly becoming a core business and function of enron and as eci expands both domestically and internationally it will require a significant amount of the state government affairs groups support you all had high draft numbers because you have either expressed an interest in working on telecom and e commerce andor are in a strategic position to assist ecis efforts my understanding from rick is that you will be out on point in your respective regions or in alecks case country in identifying issues of interest for eci provide advocacy and problem solving for ecis regional projects ie fiber builds in the south mr robinson manage regulatorylegislative efforts and help increase ecis visibility with your local policymakers that said hopefully your interest will stay high and positive and this wont seem like the real army the one with the drill sergeants and all now that we have an informal team in place and will likely add a few more folks to actively monitor and participate in telecom please feel free to calle mailvisit with myself one another or any eci person to discuss any issue or answer any question i know that many of us feel pretty overwhelmed by these issues and i dont want anyone to be intimidated we have fantastic people here at eci who can quickly bring you up to speed or provide feedback on a variety of concerns eci is doing some revolutionary things and we will become well known very soon you will get to be a part of that please let me know what issues seem hot in your areas what types of things you feel you should know more about and how much focus you believe you will able to give telecom in addition to the workload you already have there is always something going on in this industry and we will need to balance interests carefully sue nord and i will be getting out issue books to the whole state ga group here in the coming weeks this should be a useful tool to help you prioritize your workload i will be sending on to you more clips about eci our products and internal info to give you a better feel for what we are trying to accomplish we may also start some conference calls good god not another one and expect to caucus when we meet at group functions also everyone should own a newtons telecom dictionary e mail me if you dont have one i am very excited to be working alongside all of you and hope we can keep an interactive dialogue of our progress and deeds best scott

please see the pge and ferc stories below provided to me by bob weisenmiller business us market by industry ipo ap sp international prnews bizwire ccn cnw 
i understand that we may have no choice in the matter but having wtinessed loretta lynchs inability to define market power when asked to do so by joe barton last monday and having heard carl wood declare war on capitalism at fercs hearing on tuesday and knowing that the likes of harvey morse puc ferc attorney who has never come down on the side of no market power here in any analysis is heading up the puc investigation and seeing gov davis press releases demanding refunds from the faceless out of state suppliers im well maybe a little nervous about them getting their paws on our data jeff

jeff i love you but im unhappy i just dont want to be criticized anymore the thing is i know you think a lot of it is funny and ive just lost my sense of humor but the truth is after a while its just not funny anymore like when you yawned last night when i was telling a story to your friends yes its funny but when you do it every time after a while it just starts to hurt my feelings thats just one recent example youre often telling everybody how neurotic and fucked up i am or how im totally overbearing about playing the banjo in fact you just said that today to my friends at haas do you know how embarassing that was for me you should listen to yourself when you talk about me in front of your friends or my friends or my family how often do you say nice things and how often do you criticize me why dont you ask them and see what they have to say ive tried to talk to you about it i asked you to spend some time trying to say mostly nice things just for a little while but apparantly you either cant or wont and the end result is that i feel like you just dont care im sure there are things you want me to do id like to try to do them but i dont know what else i can do to make you understand that i just cant take all the criticism from you anymore it makes me feel like shit i dont know where else to go jeff i suggested talking to a shrink but youre not willing to do that either im sure that half of it is my fault and id like to work on this together but you dont seem to be willing to work on the one thing thats really hurting me and that ive asked you to work on and maybe that means you need to think about how you really feel

 a newly discovered chapter in the book of genesis has provided the answer to where do pets come from adam and eve said lord when we were in the garden you walked with us every day now we do not see you anymore we are lonesome here and it is difficult for us to remember how much you love us and god said no problem i will create a companion for you that will be with you forever and who will be a reflection of my love for you so that you will love me even when you cannot see me regardless of how selfish or childish or unlovable you may be this new companion will accept you as you are and will love you as i do in spite of yourselves and god created a new animal to be a companion for adam and eve and it was a good animal and god was pleased and the new animal was pleased to be with adam and eve and he wagged his tail and adam said lord i have already named all the animals in the kingdom and i cannot think of a name for this new animal and god said no problem because i have created this new animal to be a reflection of my love for you his name will be a reflection of my own name and you will call him dog and dog lived with adam and eve and was a companion to them and loved them and they were comforted and god was pleased and dog was content and wagged his tail after a while it came to pass that an angel came to the lord and said lord adam and eve have become filled with pride they strut and preen like peacocks and they believe they are worthy of adoration dog has indeed taught them that they are loved but perhaps too well and god said no problem i will create for them a companion who will be with them forever and who will see them as they are the companion will remind them of their limitations so they will know that they are not always worthy of adoration and god created cat to be a companion to adam and eve and cat would not obey them and when adam and eve gazed into cats eyes they were reminded that they were not the supreme beings and adam and eve learned humility and they were greatly improved and god was pleased and dog was happy and cat didnt give a s one way or the other

arm is looking at hiring a pr firm in talking to ray mcnally today re arm he discussed some recent polling data they had seen for san diego here are the highlights everyone is well aware of the energy price issue everyone is angry everyone is blaming steve peace everyone also thinks sdge is to blame that the utility is gouging people are supportive of a competitive energy market people dont buy the argument that reregulation will help consumers people are ok with having caps until more generation comes on line and people will settle for reregulation if they cant have competition his assessment was that steve peaces career is over and that the administration wants desperately to ensure that this issue goes away by the time davis has to run for re election in two years

jeff my understanding is that various level of emergencies are declared by the caiso because of power supply situations rotating outage plans are then required to be implemented by the utilities in order to reduce their power supply requirements ie electric loads the utilities chose to implement their rotating outage plans by dropping various distribution circuits that do not have essential customers connected to them on a rotating basis because it is cheap and easy to implement less controversial and less politically sensitive the following are my comments my main concern is with regards to the way they propose to handle direct access customers direct access customers should not be included in pges mandatory curtailment plan mcp because the power that these customers are using is not coming from pge anymore their power supply requirements are being met by their esps pges proposal is treating transmission level customers like utilities the only difference this time is that pge is acting like the regulator controlling the customer at a minimum the cost of implementing their proposal should be paid for by pge and not the transmission customers non firm customers such as ibm should not be included or be required to participate in their mcp anymore because their loads are dropped down to the minimum or essential levels by the caiso first even before a state of emergency is declared there is a minimum load level that facilities require in order to maintain human and environmental safety conditions please give me a call if you have any question thanks

hi did you hear from sue mara re how the california iso works
gang im finalizing what we talked about yesterday and something struck me wrt siting reform one of our key messages in california and nationally is that price spikes are due in no small part to outmoded arcane siting rules and a shortage of power as a result price spikes have led to wholesale and retail price caps investigations utility under recovery and threats of rolling back de regulation to name a few understanding that dave raises some good points about why hes not thrilled about getting involved in more siting reform bills could someone argue that from a corporate objective getting a good siting reform bill passed this session is a fairly high priority im not sure what the answer is but it struck me as i was pretty ing up the document and i thought id put it out there for reaction best jeff
fyi
i think this captures it ive also attached the posture document sue wrote up while paul takes a first crack at the cover memo please review both documents and see if there are any changes that either needs best jeff
thanks for the note im going to pass it along to the others will get back to you very soon remember that theres no team case due on monday because class is cancelled and everything got pushed back but the first individual case has to be done by tuesday best jeff

talked to bill keese of the cec this afternoon re the potential of a call on monday with the govenor himself and houstonhe told me that there is a very good chance that the govenor will call a special session in january on energy we may also want to wait to finalize the plan until after the skilling call on monday with the govenor as our strategy may shift
today friday gary fergus of the brobeck firm and i met with attny harvey morris of the cpuc to negotiate an extension of time for responding to the five subpoenas issued to enron affiliates and portland general we negotiated both an extension for initial responses two weeks plus an opportunity to submit a proposal for a significant reduction in the scope of the request for production of documents this will include a further extension for other documents that are to be produced as well as a reservation of rights to object to the production of other documents we are working in close contact with richard sanders and the epmi legal team in portland on further refining both responses and potential objections however in light of recent communications between the governors office and senior enron officials and the prospect of additional such communications both gary and i wanted to report an unusual aspect of the negotiation with the cpuc at the beginning of the meeting as we were indicating the overall burden of the request the cpuc attorney indicated the extreme pressure the commission was under to get to the bottom of what was happening in the california power markets he also recited that many parties have pledged their cooperation in this investigation to the governor he then proceeded to state that parties who delayed providing responses and raised objections to the requests for production instead of cooperating would be placed on a list of non cooperative parties which would be made available to the governor and legislators and that such parties would have to bear the consequences of such actions this rather explicit threat is in my experience unprecedented at the cpuc i also know the attorney in question well enough to know that he would never invoke political reprisals on his own and was obviously instructed to do so by cpuc pres lynch or her senior staff both gary fergus and i responded that such a threat was both improper and disturbing for a party simply trying to exercise its legitimate rights to adjudicate burdensome discovery requests but there was no attempt to withdraw the threat this comment speaks volumes about the pressure which the cpuc president feels to achieve a politically acceptable result in this matter those senior enron officials in communication with the governor should be made aware of this incident mike day
jeff well complete the draft cpuc sales report you faxed it looks like it should be mostly zeros for this period you could not have sales already in california correct and to confirm our conversation of thursday we are to recommend icas for pacific and for gteverizon enron can generally pick choose whole sections too in arizona a state court of appeals recently issued an opinion fyi which requires specific fare market price setting prior to grants of cpcn authority and this has delayed many applications pending there i will check with anita on the status of enron in arizona we also drafted several customer notices to be submitted to the cpuc with the latest tariffs and will send you copies prior to filing please let us know any questions jeremy blumenfeld cohen
first of all jeff she doesnt sit next to either myself or dylan i can go along with whatever everybody else thinks thoughts jimmy
jeff im sorry i had an issue that i wanted to resolve i wasnt upset and i was very calm when i called you but when i brought it up you just freaked out and got defensive and started yelling at me about how you couldnt do this anymore maybe you can be calmer now what i did find out was that what you thought was a discussion about moving in together was in my mind a discussion about me selling my place in order to buy my own place if i were moving in with you i would simply rent this place out as far as i remember you never said anything about me moving in with you which is fine i dont have a problem with the fact that we havent talked about moving in together thats not the issue for me what is an issue is that you seem to not want to be straight with me if you were truly talking about living together then thats what you need say if not then you shouldnt tell other people that i feel like i need to guess at what you mean i think the communication is worse when you smoke pot by the way it also upsets me that you couldnt talk to me when i called you so i guess you just cant deal with this anymore and i guess thats up to you but i do feel like youre bringing that on yourself i would like to discuss these things calmly you can call me if you want to do that
jeff mona ill be meeting with gahn benevides wood cordell stoness this afternoon re the above will call you right after

this is just a rumor but we heard on the epsa call today that scott miller is trying to get his report on the california part of his investigation to the commissioners by friday of this week also the epsaboston pacific paper continues to be revised but epsa wants to get it to ferc as soon as possible but if scott completes his report by friday it may not be in time for scotts report so they have asked us to review the report and executive summary and get comments back to them for a conference call on friday since we will be at ferc during the epsa call we will need to get any comments we may have to julie by thursday evening or friday morning thanks everyone sarah
now im not going to turn into your bruno by summarizing these types of things but the commission has adopted the cec recommendation with one modification recommended by pge
tim ive worked hard with these guys to try to make this conference the best that it could be but it aint quite there so id rather keep our powder dry and use skilling at another time not top shelf enough in my view if you want to discuss further let me know also one question is the beep stack the constrained supply curve post adjustment bids i have that right
if you have any questions dont hesitate
between you and me i dont think california is an option at this point
hi jeff i just saw the fax regarding the quarterly fee statement for reimbursement account for california do you know if there is someone in accounting who has the document and who has responsibility for taking care of it thanks sue
attached is write up that discusses pges past behavior and outlines the various facts that could lead to a compromise solution please read it because i think it is very enlightening and may be a useful tool in discussions with regulators legislators the governor and pge if you have any other thoughts please share them with us i have omitted a write up on a post freeze market structure and defer to government affairs on articulating a proposal that is competitively friendly roger
couple of thoughts in light of all the events that have transpired yesterday and today seems that the ious have decided to up the ante considerably likely in response to a pounding theyre taking from wall street this will likely increase the pressure for davis to act sooner rather than later at least wrt finding a way out of the iou undercollection problem the increased pressure to act in turn increases the likelihood that a bad solution will emerge regarding the call on monday with davis the added heat being applied might argue for coming up with a simple concrete proposal that we can hand to davis and that he can implement immediately to get the ious off his back and avoid having the adminstration cook up something less preferable
fyi rebecca got back in touch wanting to talk about the history of dereg in california been trading messages when she gets back to me with what she wants to discuss ill check back in before having the conversation question what about giving her a copy of our high tech slides with the intent of getting her to do a story on it she might be a good carrier thoughts one story has already hit the sj mercury news best jeff
heres the next version of the slides few points there are a few holes pre quals and process in particular my brain began to fail but i think theres enough of a structure so that we can easily finalize by tomorrow i didnt have an electronic version of whaleys slides so i couldnt integrate them but i dont think it will take much to do the integration some of whaleys slides have a strong marketing slant we should think hard about whether we include them lest we lose our mantle of objectivity we still have some wordsmithing to do re participate run the auction or participate and run the auction best jeff

beep stack is the supply curve for real time energy that the iso develops on the basis of bids and offers the problem is that the plants the iso ultimately dispatches from the stack often conflict with the merit order developed from the bidsoffers and the iso has never been clear about the decision metrics it uses to determine ultimate dispatch everyone including belden thinks it can and ought to be a helluvalot more transparent

as a follow up to our call here is some additional information regarding qf pricing issues qfs who voluntarily switched to px pricing have been getting paid full px prices and there seem to be a couple of thousand mws that have switched the concern is that the commissions ultimate decision on px based qf prices will force the qfs that have switched to refund some of the payments theyve received eg under a px minus mechanism the majority of qfs are happy with the judges proposed decision pending before the puc except those remotely located qfs who will take a big gmm hit as we discussed the commission strongly rejected edisons emergency motion regarding the gas piece of the qf pricing formula recall also that a couple of months ago

dear evening mba students several weeks ago i informed you of changes in access to stanfords libraries jackson business library which is not part of the main stanford libraries was not aware of this change because no one at stanford told them jackson library has implemented the following temporary procedures for ucb student access which should remain in place until the end of this term as of now you may use your ucb ids for entry if you want to check out any materials jackson business library will issue you a separate borrowing card which will be good through december were hoping we will be able to work out a smoother long term arrangement with them for next term this procedure is only for jackson business library the main stanford libraries will continue to honor your ucb ids without you requiring an additional borrowing card monica singh evening mba librarian

were getting close to a final draft of our filing in fercs investigation of the wholesale market in california so if you would like an opportunity to read it please get me your comments by tomorrow the motion still does not have a section on governance but ron is drafting it and it will simply summarize seabrons paper also i made some changes to rons draft to require the ferc to find that it has a pervasive system of wholesale regulations in california and that the cpuc is therefore pre empted from placing restrictions on hedging by wholesale market participants i think that argument could be extended to cover the udcs recovery of stranded costs but have not added that to the draft i wanted to get your feed back first if the stranded cost mechanism isnt fixed im not sure that the other market changes we have recommended will be sufficient on the other hand maybe the puc is on its way to fixing this part of the problem do you want to have this discussion via e mail or do you want a conference call on this

jim to say that there was gaming in the uk pool is a significant understatement couple thoughtsim pretty sure that seab has done extensive analysis on the uk and hed likely therefore be very useful in developing rebuttal though very close to it at one point ive been removed for a few years also schroeder and his gang could also likely shed some insights and seems that schroeders pretty close now with littlechild that might be another avenue for information to rebut best jeff

monday la wkaren denne tuesday in office wednesday travel to houston thursday houston friday houston
for those who attended section i promised to clarify whether the lm needed to shift if a country on fixed exchange rates chose to devalue when suddenly facing a higher risk premium because of the risk premium and the outflow of capital at the prevailing interest rate r the absence of any central bank action combined with allowing the exchange rate to float automatically lowers the exchange rate so no shift of the lm curve is required basically the demand for assets denominated in the currency has declined thereby putting downward pressure on the currency the decision to float the exchange rate accomodates this decline in demand and the central bank does not need to increase money supply to cause the devaluation it happens on its own of course the new exchange rate should be pegged at the level where rr theta now in the future the central bank will do whatever is required to keep the exchange rate at the new level for those who dont follow this dont worry it is a fairly technical point but i wanted to make sure i clarified it bhash

hi guys i just wanted you to know that i am currently working on posting the mid term solutions on the web they should be available by tonight i apologize the delay and thanks for your patience madhur duggar
this is a summary i prepared in the form of a briefing paper for use by our legislative team thought you might find it useful ray
i have posted your grades on the class web page under grades as you will see as a whole you did very well this was great to see congratulations to you all the exam was definitely on the hard side yet the median score was still very high as usual in cases such as these i will take all the credit jonathan
in the same decision that the cpuc is considering voting out on suspending direct access the cpuc is considering a socal edison recommendation to suspend further payment of the negative ctc to marketers the decision would find that the earlier stipulation does not require sce to make a cash payment in lieu of a bill credit even though sce has already paid cash in previous periods for the negative ctc the decision orders sce to not make cash payments to satisfy the negative ctc credit the decision is unclear as to whether or not this is simply a suspension of payment or would be permanent the decision would apply the same findings and rulings to pge and sdge the key issue is that rather than having a cash receivable ees would now have a bill credit receivable in addition because ees re sourced its customers the utility account that holds the bill credit is ees not the customer account the only method to obtain the economic value of the bill credit is to utilize the utilities services even if ees physically serves the customers going forward it may not be the same account that has the bill credit the outcome of this case would impact our current complaint but it is unclear exactly how the cpuc would apply this decision to that case we are intending to a try to remove this issue from the cpuc decision b trying to clarify the suspension is not meant as a vehicle to deny us payment and c trying to determine that the utilities tariff would allow us to be paid if our account became inactive one other option to consider at least for sce would be to contact sce management to work out a bill credit application process to allow ees to route the economic value to our da customers if anyone has any questions please call me to discuss jim
please find attached a detailed briefing paper on the captioned order ray alvarez

paul and jeff becky donna and i gas girls met with phillip allen ena west to discuss ferc gas issues today and phillip had some issues that were more state than federal and i told him i would bring them to your attention he is interested in seeing incentive rates or more hedging on the part of the ca ldcs so that all their needs are not being served by the spot market in the current market hedges longer term contracting and financial are being done primarily by the producers and marketers which results in a thin and probably off kilter market the ldcs buying for the customers are not participating i know we have to square this with the ees positions but i am not up to speed on what is going on in ca on this issue phillip also made that point that while the ldcs are focusing on their core load no one is doing system planning on the macro basis taking into account the ability of the physical systems to meet the needs of all customers core and non core and making sure the system will be adequate finally he is very interested in seeing the ca ldc rates unbundled any updates we can provide to phillip and the gas girls would be appreciated as well as what our plans are to address these issues from our side el paso is having a conference in july and we will be taking up a number of allocation and transportation issues at that time thanks

jeff to follow up on my voice mail message i would like your feedback as i develop a message around the dwr stranded costs alan ban and i have been in touch with the egm fundamentals and utility risk management groups to build upon their financialtechnical analysis of the contracts i have also had some limited feedback from michael tribolet on credit issues in the contracts chris calger just came by i am in the portland office today to say that he wants to make sure that he is part of the discussion concerning our message on these stranded costs apparently there are some commercial sensitivities for example a current deal with allegheny some areas for input who is our audience ca state or federal what is our message eg contracts will impede da dwr has overcommitted etc what form should our message take presentation memo one pager attached is a presentation i started thanks jennifer
lets discuss further ive been in close contact with chris on this im not sure that we necessarily need a presentation on the issue speaking only for california policy makers and industry participants know a that theres a problem and b that the magnitude of the problem is significant and theres not a heckuvalot of leg work that needs to be done on that front i would suggest that we continue to work on analysis internally and spend some time discussing further the extent to which we need a presentation for external consumption as everyones aware this issue is a very complicated one and sensitive one for enron and we need to be very careful wrt how we approach it thoughts best jeff

gang the final letter and document will be given to the speaker shortly as you may know turn ultimately decided not to participate also late last week the utility workers had an elected change of leadership and there was not enough time to bring the new officers up to speed by our deadline the speaker plans on using our product to simultaneously encourage the puc not to close the door on direct access and if necessary convince the legislature to pass this year a meaningful direct access program if the puc goes south on us also i believe he hopes that our work will help convince the legislature to move to restore sce to financial stability and to do so rapidly this last month has been very interesting to me oddly satisfying is how i described it even if most of you did object to the phrasing and i appreciate the opportunity of working with you for whatever reasons there is nothing like an intractable social and political problems to get me interested thanks very much for participating phil

executive summary direct access could make a rescue of socal edison more difficult bond issuances for california may be in jeopardy as direct access becomes more popular with municipalities municipal power is politically attractive there is growing pressure across california for cities to consider forming their own municipal power companies community leaders across the state are enviously eyeing the success of sacramentos smud utility and the los angeles municipal power utility where rate hikes and service disruptions have been far less pronounced than the rest of the state several leaders in san francisco are considering setting up their own power company and another two dozen cities are also contemplating action municipal power companies are not subject to regulation by the california public utilities commission and could therefore sidestep the current proposed structure of rate hikes trying to stop municipalities from opting out of the state power plans will be extremely difficult as it runs against some of the most entrenched and long standing privileges in california politics under california law it is very difficult to stop many cities from doing what they feel is in their best interest most older and larger cities are charter cities rather than general law cities subject to the california municipal code under the california constitution charter cities can pretty much do anything or provide any service short of printing money and raising an army the league of california cities a weighty organization representing every one of californias cities is already swinging into action to support direct access most assembly democrats started out as city councilors and have some sympathy with local independence and the resistance within the assembly is already building against hertzbergs attempts to stop even large companies getting direct access some city leaders will not wish to fight the governor and the state legislature on the issue but if municipalities do not opt out they may have to explain to their local business and voters why they are paying far more for electricity than a city next door which chooses to set up its own power company cities are beginning to realize they might potentially lose major employers politicians are also beginning to realize that local companies stand to gain or lose a fortune on this matter and this could affect campaign contributions state power plans at risk if municipalities do move to set up their own power companies it could undermine at least three key elements of the state of californias power plans first the rate hike already approved falls mostly on businesses and other large users but municipal power would unpick this structure allow large regions of california to ignore the puc leaving the rate structure to be determined city by city many municipalities may be unable to resist pressure from local businesses to protect them from disproportionate rate hikes others might cave into irate voters second the plans laid out by governor davis and state treasurer angelides for a california state public power authority would also be badly damaged if large regions avoid having anything to do with it it is possible that long term power contracts might also face an additional hurdle if municipalities opt out of higher long term rates by buying on the open market it could mean the state is left with excess power that it would have to sell at a loss third revenues to back the proposed power bond could be imperiled if municipalities opt out of the rate structure and revenue stream needed to repay the bond and if the momentum for direct access develops among the cities and municipalities across the state it could make it much more difficult to launch the bond in the first place as investors may take fright at potential threats to the viability of repayments the issue is at an early stage the puc had a general workshop on the matter at its offices in san francisco on friday state legislative leaders are likely to use every political and legal means available to stop municipal secession or at least smother the issue until the power bond is successfully away but stopping the municipalities if they choose to follow this path could prove to be difficult

according to the la times we know the sec has launched a preliminary investigation into whether davis administration staff used inside information to buy stock in that case its a big question whether proprietary information not available to the public was properly safeguarded i think this is further evidence that the information requeted from enron by the ca state senate could be in similar jeopardy

 there is a serious effort currently underway in california to unseat senator burton d san francisco president pro tem even though the chances of this happening are relatively low john bryson ceo of socal with the support of the governor are making huge efforts to oust burton and replace him with one of two potential candidates richard alarcon d san fernando valley majority whip or sheila kuehl d los angeles alarcon has already stated that he would not accept the position however at minimum bryson governor davis andor other senators hope that burton will rethink his position on the mou and a socal bailout additionally behind the scenes things are looking very grim for california due the implications of direct access the biggest opponent of direct access comes from the governors office as they realize the potential effects of direct access and how it could undermine the revenue stream supporting the bond issuance

hello fellow equinephiles i received positive responses anything other than yes is bad very very bad downright negative from madeleine rob nora and pat carl sounds like he is interested but has other things on his mind at the moment alice has some silly concern about a roof over her head saying that she needs to take care of the house first if anyone else is considering the trip please let me know soon the big question is about the timing rob and nora have expressed a preference for august pat is trying to get intel to spring for her airfare by calling it a business trip can you say junket because pat has only the best interest of the company in mind she feels april would be a good time to go my preference is to go just before or after the tourist season which would be the beginning of june or september the folks at porlock advised me thus depending on the wetness of the winter season the outdoor jump arenas and x country courses open in early may to early june by mid june the local tourist season is in full swing bookings will be more difficult and we will have to compete with a good bit of traffic on the roads and trails during hacks hikers use the same trails that we will canter the tourist season lasts through august when much of europe and the uk are taking summer holidays so please help me find a time that is suitable for everyone my vote is to go at the end of august beginning of september what do you think of that jeff ps pat i am only kidding whats the point of working for a multi national if you cant get some good trips out of it internet email confidentiality footer privilegedconfidential information may be contained in this message if you are not the addressee indicated in this message or responsible for delivery of the message to such person you may not copy or deliver this message to anyone in such case you should destroy this message and kindly notify the sender by reply email please advise immediately if you or your employer do not consent to internet email for messages of this kind opinions conclusions and other information in this message that do not relate to the official business of my firm shall be understood as neither given nor endorsed by it

sandi and dave and mike will dicuss further on the call on monday but wanted to disseminate info regarding the meeting that joe ronan of calpine offered on an iep call today the meeting was attended by a lot of folks of all stripes wright was very critical of how the governor is handling the issue and wants to craft a solution with the industry and then invite the governor to get on board wright threw a whole laundry list of options on the table for folks to consider daves typing up his notes from the meeting for distribution later today one of wrights key concern is forward contracting the utilities said that loretta lynch is the problem with the onerous prudence criteria shes imposing on utility forward contracts those onerous criteria keep the utility from contracting much discussion of what california does on the gas side ie set an objective benchmark price if the utility beats it they profit if they do worse they take the hit the utility under this framework has broad flexibility to contract forward ie puc gets out of the way fyi coincidentally i suggested this approach in very broad terms pointing to the fact that its already successfully in use on the gas side during a panel discussion that i participated in yesterday at the california energy markets conference the utilities told rod wright that they did not want nor did they have the expertise to get back into the generation business

greetings wayne sorry that i missed the last meeting ill be attending by phone this week but would like to attend in person as often as i can understanding that our meetings will be weekly now dont shoot me but i was wondering if it might be possible to have the meetings on thursday mornings that way i could actually be in houston for the meetings which my schedule doesnt permit me to do on wednesdays if its too complicated dont sweat it i can continue to do the meetings by phone but if thursdays can fit into folks schedule that would be great thanks and talk to you on wednesday best jeff
i just want to confirm how we have agreed to proceed we will start our work focussing on b commercially significant interfaces rather than a identification etc on the understanding that our work on the regional issues may shift into a discussion of a we will work in three sub groups northeast roy boston steve montovano aleck dadson south ricardo charvel kathleen magruder jeff dasovich and northwest rob hemstock and one or both of jeff dasovich mary hain i will approach mary hain to join the group and work in the northwest subgroup each subgroup will produce a workplan and focus document by the end of february those three documents will be circulated to the whole group and discussed on a conference call for the whole group in the first week in march each subgroup will make their own determination about how they will carry out their work meetings telephone calls e mail etc but the group will endeavour to do all of its group level work by e mail and telephone we will aim to have a work product to deliver from the group by may at this stage it is likely that the final work product will consist of a document or documents identifying impediments and opportunities and the ways of mitigatingpursuing them however as we discussed on the call we should keep an open mind about the nature of the work product we will have a better idea of what work product to aim for after the completionreview of the initial workplans
 a farmer got pulled over by a state trooper for speeding and the trooper started to lecture the farmer about his speed and in general began to throw his weight around to try to make the farmer uncomfortable finally the trooper got around to writing out the ticket and as he was doing that he kept swatting at some flies that were buzzing around his head the farmer said having some problems with circle flies there are ya the trooper stopped writing the ticket and said well yeah if thats what they are i never heard of circle flies so the farmer says well circle flies are common on farms see theyre called circle flies because theyre almost always found circling around the back end of a horse the trooper says oh and goes back to writing the ticket then after a minute he stops and says heywait a minute are you trying to call me a horses ass the farmer says oh no officer i have too much respect for law enforcement and police officers to even think about calling you a horses ass the trooper says well thats a good thing and goes back to writing the ticket after a long pause the farmer says hard to fool them flies though

dave parquet and i spoke with smutney of iep re herding the cats in true swedish hostage syndrome fashion smutney informed us that none of ieps members has screamed about the ferc proposed cap he added that the industry is under siege and that just saying no to price caps isnt politically tenable he also said that he hadnt planned on mentioning price caps in his remarks we expressed concern that it would be hard for the head of californias generator association to avoid the topic we stressed the importance of having iep disagree with fercs cap proposal and offered the following message points price caps have failed in the past and theyll fail again fercs and californias immediate goal ought to be to make the bold reforms necessary to create real competitive markets and eliminate the need for price caps altogether the most important reforms include reforming californias siting laws to permit entry of supply best way to undermine high prices is easy entry by competitors reforming the puc review of utility purchases give the utilities financial incentives to purchase efficiently ie similar to californias gas market where a benchmark is set and the ious profit or lose on the basis of whether the iou does better or worse than the benchmark it aint rocket science and it works the cpuc gets out of the way and stops the practice of after the fact reviews of power purchases creating a retail market if californiaferc adopt these reforms the need for caps will vanish ferc got a lot right in the order but the price cap proposal is flawed price is too low to incent development of peakers well functioning efficient markets require peakers information disclosure provisions are too costly and unnecessary disincents energy efficiency iep written comments will offer suggestions on how to remedy the flaws in the proposed cap smutney was comfortable with these points and is open to hearing more from us today and tomorrow if folks have comments on these points or have others we should discuss with smutney dont hesitate best jeff

heres a start try em out for size more to follow best jeff price caps have failed in the past and theyll fail again fercs and californias immediate goal ought to be to make the bold reforms necessary to create real competitive markets and eliminate the need for price caps altogether the most important reforms include reforming californias siting laws to permit entry of supply best way to undermine high prices is easy entry by competitors reforming the puc review of utility purchases give the utilities financial incentives to purchase efficiently ie similar to californias gas market where a benchmark is set and the ious profit or lose on the basis of whether the iou does better or worse than the benchmark it aint rocket science and it works the cpuc gets out of the way and stops the practice of after the fact reviews of power purchases creating a retail market if californiaferc adopt these reforms the need for caps will vanish ferc got a lot right in the order but the price cap proposal is flawed price is too low to incent development of peakers well functioning efficient markets require peakers information disclosure provisions are too costly and unnecessary disincents energy efficiency iep written comments will offer suggestions on how to remedy the flaws in the proposed cap

i may be wrong but trying to follow the press and houston originated e mails i am under the impression that ferc has issued an order finding that california prices were not unjust and unreasonable and that generators did not abuse marketpower in recent price setting exercise and that there may be a california puc order relevant to the recent price flare up any way as jeff will know a uk academic is going to be presenting in berkley and tokyo later this month arguing that hogan and joskow are wrong about the value of retail competition and he expressed an interest in being current on recent agency pronouncements to make this long story shorter are there citationsreferences to such orders that i could provide to the good professor admittedly doing a bit of his work for him but hopefully by being current his message will be more on if yes can i get the ferc cites and web reference from joe or sarah and any california puc order citation and web reference from jeff many thanks mcs

mark faced with the price spikes in california the new administration led by governor davis has been pretty hostile toward deregulation perhaps the administrations and its california puc hostility represents a placeholder until the administration comes up with its own plan to fix the mess that california refers to as a market as such there hasnt been much coming out of the california puc other than rhetoric regarding the fact that republicans not democratics restructured californias market and the desire to go backwards to good ol cost of service command and control regulation however the iso and the px have issued interesting reports which ill forward in a seperate email i look forward to seeing prof littlechild at the conference on monday hes on the first panel im on the second ive attached the url for info on the conference httpgsppberkeleyedueventselectricitysummitconferencehtm best jeff

kevin pursuant to your request for a term sheet that would propose legislation to enable broadband access for every home and business in an attempt to bridge the digital divide please see the attached document below the term sheet incorporates several federal solutions to funding a fiber or dsl build out that will support high speed connectivity for residential and business premises including a take back of hdtv spectrum and subsequent auction thereof as well as the establishment of individual tax credits or a broadband buildout and internet access trust fund while the term sheet describes different opportunities for the government to endorse the build out of last mile infrastructure the federal solutions set forth do not have a high probability of enactment by the next congress thus we are identifying additional means of promoting broadband access through state and municipal governments as well as private initiatives we will forward a supplemental document to you in the coming weeks that describes additional avenues perhaps we could meet at that time to discuss the full array of options i look forward to hearing your thoughts or comments regards lara

sure sue has filled you in but just to be certain my understanding is that dan douglas attorney for wptf is going to meet with the ag not sure when in an attempt to narrow the scope of the subpoena dan also plans to begin drafting responses to the subpeona since we are a member of wptf and therefore presumably covered by the subpoena seems important that our attorneys coordinate with dan sue if ive mangled anything let me know best jeff
rob heres a quick and dirty list of some lessons from california that alberta may not want to repeat steve let me know if ive missed any messages were using to describe californias woes or mangled any for that matter if you have any questions dont hestitate to get in touch best jeff

jeff iso is still working on the specifications and interconnection points of their capacity the delay is due to some discussions with a current user which may result in more capacity being available ill keep you posted this message contains information which may be confidential and privileged unless you are the addressee or authorized to receive for the addressee you may not use copy or disclose to anyone the message or any information contained in the message if you have received the message in error please advise the sender by reply e mail mofocom and delete the message thank you very much

these performance reviews may push me right over the edge good talking to you earlier sounded like the paul i know and admire you sounded energized looking forward to having you around more one thing please dont count december out as a possible start time for the special session anything can happen book your hotel room early best jeff
rick just want to let you know that i missed the boat a bit in coordinating my reviewers with paul in my first attempt to input them in the system i hesitated including you for the simple reason that im certain you have countless other reviews to do already and frankly i feel that youre an integral part of my review whether youre formally on the list or not when i went back to make my final additions to the list the systerm was already closed paul had approved the first round which i guess shuts it down its likely not appropriate for reviews to happen outside the system but i wanted to let you know that from my perspective it would be great to receive from you id value it a lot and i think weve worked closely enough together over the last year for you to have a basis for reviewing me but again im of the view that irrespective of the list you partake in my review of necessity and i dont want to add any additional burdens to an already loaded schedule no big deal just wanted to let you know and im having a field day filling out your review rick discriminates unfairly against neon colored shirts seriously i was quite pleasantly surprised to have ended up as one of your reviewers best jeff
its a never ending cavalcade
fyi margaret carson
hello everyone weve gotten word back from jim fallon to go forward with obtaining clec licenses this brings us to the next set of questions which entity do we license ebs or eti if we license eti as a clec can we transfer ebs ixc licenses to eti do we get clec licenses in all states or some strategic subset of states id like to put together a group to address these questions working with legal tax and commercial people please let me know if you are interested in participating in this group it most likely will involve a fairly intensive schedule of meetings in houston during december we should hold off on filing new ixc license applications until we have resolved the ebs vs eti issue for states where an ebs ixc license application currently is pending lets not be too aggressive in pushing those applications forward over the next month give me a call if this creates a problem in any of your states also scott please let everyone know if there are any fiber build states where you think the delay would be a problem feel free to give me a call if you have any questions sue

greetings linda let me open by saying welcome and by apologizing for the fact that california has probably made your first days on the job a bit crazy just wanted to pass along some info im sure youve seen senator feinsteins comments to ferc and i think youre aware that she held a meeting in california with a group of stakeholders including davis staff on the day before fercs recent workshop at which steve testified she stated at the meeting that she is thinking seriously about sponsoring legislation to place a price cap on the entire wscc market economists in the room expressed their strong misgivings about caps but feinstein seemed fairly focused on at least sponsoring some sort of legislation not sure where it will go but wanted to pass it along best jeff

the following is a statement for use in response to the lawsuit filed in san diego today this is a publicity stunt three separate federal and state regulatory agencies have investigated the allegations rehashed in this lawsuit and found that no market power was exercised in california this lawsuit is completely without merit and is yet another attempt to fix blame rather than fix the problem in california california needs a strong forward market so utilities can hedge out the volatility in the spot power market and california needs incentives for companies to build adequate generation in the state

hi guys the house commerce committee currently has five republican vacancies with two likely to go to californians last week leadership determined that freshman members are ineligible for this assignment obviously it is important that these new california members be supportive of enron on electricity restructuring currently congresswoman mary bono and congressman george radanovich have expressed their interest in securing appointment to this committee we can certainly work with these members but are there other non freshman california republican members who would be better many members are unaware of how few members are seeking these vacancies so a little education on our part could sway their interest please advise many thanks cynthia

i spoke with jeff dasovich yesterday he has a meeting with gray davis policy director next wednesday jeff said it is a half hour who we are and what we want meeting with her i mentioned what we are looking for and why we think it would be valuable for davis to get behind it jeff was all over it especially since there are huge davis chambers ties jeff asked for us to put together a one page bullet point overview that he can give to her on wed definitely wants us to present it as a ciscoenronpowertek plan he thinks that the cisco name will be crucial for us to beeline the process to obtain jeff thinks that after she reviews this we will have a good chance to meet with her or davis folks to begin the process of obtaining funds however jeff thinks that the more we can drag cisco into the mix the better chances we have if we are going to put ciscos name on this you probably need to talk to your contacts before we move forward call me to discuss

got your message re reverse auction all of the utilitys demand getting interestingly complicated though now the utilities want to create a corenoncore split in electricity like in gas where large gas customers cant take commodity from the utility with a corenoncore split edison claims that qf contracts nukes and other existing generation that it still holds is sufficient to meet core needs and it therefore may not need contracts as you can imagine large customers aint clamoring to get thrown into the market as noncore customers right about now but they may find themselves without a choice i talked to calger on friday about reverse auction versus benchmark and ill be talking to the traders about it this afternoon and well be discussing further when rick steffes et al are here tomorrow will let you know where it goes best jeff

jeff please pass this note onto whomever on the call asked the question what would enron be paid if there was an electricity curtailment i talked with staff on the west desk and confirmed that if there is an unscheduled electricity curtailment ie rolling or widespread blackout power scheduled by ees to a retail customer would still flow assuming it had been prescheduled epmi acting as eess scheduling coordinator or sc would be paid the iso decremental dec price for that power epmi would pass that revenue along with the cost of supplying that power onto ees if the blackout continued for some time ie days presumably ees would adjust its preschedule and there would be no net sales into the iso whether the retail customer gets a payment for being curtailed depends completely on the contract between ees and the customer presumably the force majure provisions of the contract would protect ees from utility blackouts alan comnes

mark i dont know how any concerns i may have raised reached you but rest assured that there are no worries from my end i saw the piece on the local news vacars on a one person crusade to kill capitalism thats certain it was very clear that you were taken horribly out of context and they did you a great disservice just between us chickens it did come up as if you were implying that theres some reasonable likelihood that manipulations the culprit you can imagine just how sensitive we are to that issue but i dont think that you should sweat it in a very brief conversation with mike day i mentioned the piece and that they got you responding to manipulation ie whend you stop beating your wife on camera so agitated was i that i didnt even bother to bring it up with herr fawcett so again thanks much for the note but no big deal now for my two cents question whats the problem answer very bad state energy policy and here are the five big regulatory problems standing in the way of a solution for california market manipulation well those charges are raised in every industry whenever prices spike the lions share of the time it turns out to be market fundamentals appreciate your note thanks jeff

paul heres additional info for the curtailment data that were pulling together utility pricing for core gas customers prior to the month in question the utility forecasts gas prices based on nymex monthly prices so for example based on novembers forecast the utility sets prices to be charged to core consumers in december when decembers over the utility compares forecast prices with actual prices if the forecast was too low and theres an undercollection the utility will increase januarys price forecast by just enough to make up for the december undercollection if prices were too high and theres an overcollection the utility will reduce january price forecast by just enough to refund the overcollection if the overcollectionundercollection is very large the utilities have generally spread out the true up over several months to avoid rate shock one way or the other however under the current circumstances the utilities may be less willing to spread it out and may wish to recover the entire undercollection in the following month in short theres at least a one month lag in customer prices to account for differences in forecasts versus actual

i have received several comments about the wsj data request enrons tim beldon wrote me that he would consider it the pxs gene waas was concerned based on previous experiences of letting data go to the wsj i talked with dynegys lynn lednicky this morning and he suggested that the px has aggregated data for several days and that releasing the aggregate data with individual bid data from our members would give the wsj a better window into the issues that is simply releasing your bid data will not tell the wsj anything of value i know that rebecca would insist that the dates for which any data are polled our at her choice not ours it must be necessary to assure there is no possibility of bias i am wondering if the px would be willing to assist us by putting together aggregate data for days which the wsj selects and then give us the opportunity to release our individual data for the same days i am also wondering if we shouldnt have an off the record teleconference call with the wsj whereby both sides can get a better understanding of what the wsj wants and how we can best provide it would anyone be interested in me setting up such a meeting for next week say wednesday or thursday gba

here are some suggestions for the op ed piece one general comment it may be a bit lengthy at this point also have we decided whether it would be our op ed piece and one key point that is very commercially sensitive the term end the rate freeze has very ominous implications for eess book depending on the timing of any such end in california thus my heavy handed edits on that portion nice job jeannie best jeff
i remain a supporter of this joint effort but a victim of impossible schedule conflicts so im enlarging briefly on my last note in response to the latest draft in principle nrdc can support rate stabilization proposals that include a stable commodity charge but we and others will have huge problems with proposals that are structured as a frozen bundled rate that includes distribution costs when you do the latter you tie distribution revenue recovery directly to throughput over the wires ensuring that both energy efficiency and on site distributed resources will reduce distribution revenue recovery and that a lack of both will have the opposite effect while i know not all on this list share our objective of breaking this throughput addiction for distribution companies there is no reason to prejudge the issue in the proposal from this group
thank you have a nice holiday best jeff

status report utility solvency status report ebs in california
in case you have not seenmargaret
paul kaufman phoned with the following brief report from the western governors association energy summit that took place today paul will follow up with more detail when he gets back to a computer the governors issued the following recommendations california should immediately implement fercs order issued last friday and aggressively pursue all available dsm and conservation opportunties the western region should likewise be much more aggressive in identifying and implementing dsm and efficiency opportunities increase supply as soon as possible ferc should do an investigation into the potentially negative effects that price caps can cause in the industry ferc should add to its investigations an investigation into what caused the price spikes in the first week of december work with the bush transition team to make sure that someone from the new administration is focused on the issue hoecker said that he is not inclined to impose a region wide cap until california takes the actions it needs to take to help alleviate the situation eg reforming regs governing utility forward contracts jeff

jeff we need to add some discussion focused on qf issues in california and how resolution to certain items would enhance qf ownership and provide the utilities with optimal performance of the qfs and perhaps encourage new capacity development at existing qf locations the utilities should be motivated to enter into buyout buydown blend and extend negotiate fixed energy prices and other restructuring transactions with the qfs the utilites have the ability to hedge the floating price currently being paid to the qfs they should be motivated to look into these structures utilities should provide some clarification to the energy prices under qf ppas there is alot of risks around srac and px that affect both the utilities and the qf owners it seems like resolution to that risk is beneficial to both the utility as well as the qf qfs should have the ability to move excess capacity and energy into either the market andor to the utility that would create additional economic incentives for the qfs to run and perhaps increase their capacity frank
can you do this

business week article speaking on how deregulation is the solution for power markets
best of luck youve got a tough job guess youll be working that much harder now that john stevens is on his way to san francisco at last weeks meeting a request was made for peak and off peak prices ive attached prices that we filed yesterday at ferc as part of its on going proceeding of forward contracts few comments wed appreciate it if you could keep the information confidential particularly since the information is covered by fercs confidentiality provisions since we are not a generator we buy and sell in the market which as you know is currently very volatile consequently the quotes that we provide customers change daily to reflect changing market prices these prices were put together and filed yesterday but you may have heard that prices were down today so quotes we made today were lower and quotes we makes tomorrow will reflect tomorrows market conditions and will likely be different from todays because these quotes were assembled yesterday they are only indicative that is if someone wanted to buy these products today wed have to recalculate prices because the quotes established yesterday are no longer valid for the reasons i mentioned above hope this helps if you have any questions let me know best jeff
attached are the final versions of confidential materials provided to the governors office best jeff

may be of interest from a licensing perspective

i sent kari dohn some more information today thanks jim for the pennsylvania info in the note i asked her if the rumors about securitization are true and whether the governor indeed intends to push it actively i also mentioned that we viewed it as a very promising option particularly if accompanied by significant concessions by the utilities the response from kari is very encouraging and will hopefully help the utilities credit position though i heard pge was downgraded to junk by at least one credit agency today but havent confirmed it think its prudent to keep karis info very close to the vest heres kariher response jeff thank you so much for the information re securitization i dont think the exact form has been decided in terms of legislation but its fair to say there are very active discussions at the highest level regarding the best way to do this with good support between us it appears all major parties will need to be supportive
i hear you feels like i havent slept for about a week congratulations securitization would be an extremely constructive outcome if theres anything at all that we can do to help please dont hesitate to ask since folks view us as well somewhat controversial we continue to try to do productive things away from the spot light talk to you soon best jeff

jeffjim i assume jeff is handling the response to the oraturn filing to alter the pge tariffs on gas diversions let me know if you need anything from me on that or anything else thanks
jim ora has made a filing with the cpuc to amend the tariff provisions applicable to diversions so that the utility would not have to pay such high prices for diverting gas and reducing some of the penalties as well jeff dasovich and i have been emailing each other on this and it is probably a good idea for us to file something in response to the ora request no one has yet talked to mike day about this but i will call him and ask him to draft a response for us if that is okay with you it may be that diversions are less likely in light of the doe order but perhaps it is better to protect ourselves what say you
you alive
jeff this is tim ray long time no talk to i am with new power now and am in need of talking over socal gas accord with you we are contemplating entering the calf market however it sounds like there are a myriad of changes to be implemented by socal this year that would effect cost curves and marketing i need to spend some time talking to you about these and how they can effect us i am really not familiar with the accord issues at all so i am in true need of your help

steve asked that i forward this to you confidential talking points for lays conversation with glynn
mike here is the situation between ena and ees we sell gas to core and non core customers and also have gas in storage as well as in the park and lend service i think we can be sympathetic to the ora argument that the diversion tariff penalties did not anticipate ofos and efos in situations such as we face here shortages due to credit problems rather than lack of supply assessing extreme penalties as the ofoefos would do on users who are not perfectly imbalance under this situation certainly seems unfair however i think we should argue that limiting the payments to shipperscustomers whose gas is diverted to serve core customers to a market index may not fully compensate for the diversion the pay back specifically does not include interstate pipeline charges and there may be other costs as well to the marketercustomer who had supplies taken away i need an estimate of the cost to make this filing and follow it up for the rcr process and i would also like any feedback anyone has on what our position should be in this matter the response is due friday
though i didnt have a problem with the course agenda im comfortable with the alternative
i just spoke with harry and perhaps we can also argue that reducing the diversion payments to index creates an unfair incentive for pge to actually divert gas since there is no economic penalty for doing so

in the attempt to delete the millions of emails ive received from telecom reports i deleted your western gov update before reading it could you resend your pal jeff
will do thought that you were already on
my apologies i took a vacation that i was in much need of and as you know its more hectic trying to take off on vacation than it is coping with the day to day mess and i came back to utter chaos regarding my homework assignment i checked my records and lo and behold i am completely vested that said i also thought long and hard about making a switch and came to the conclusion that the switch would need to be a significant one in order to make leaving a compelling proposition of course it goes without saying that working with you is about as compelling as it gets but when i stack up the other pieces of the puzzle they seem somewhat less compelling than the opportunity to work with you it is so enticing but it is with extreme regret that i am inclined to decline your gracious offer would be happy to discuss it further and you know without me saying that i am honored that you considered me and greatly appreciative give a holler when you find a minute best jeff
fyi
david you have done a great job in putting this together and i would like to endorse it i have only two concerns that have been noted by others first as mitch wilk pointed out the utilities were not required to sell their power plants but they were encouraged to do so second i agree with bill hogan that the last paragraph of the summary takes an unnecessary swipe at the governor you may want to end the summary in the same tone you ended the manifesto phillip

here is the latest with comments from everyone mds
jeff i have never been accused of being subtle however someone had to say it and it is better to say it now than to have it come out later phil dear david i am writing this note to you and not the committee i am worried that too many of the signatories can be accused of trying use their academic positions to achieve results desired by their consulting clients i riase this issue because more than one person has told me that paul joscow is owned by edison while such statements are generally wrong i believe you need to be sensitive to the potential attack in particular i worry that our efforts will be undermined if too many of the individuals signing the report have had extensive dealings with the states three largest utilities i can just see the headline apologists for utilities offer solutions to states energy problems you know we will be attacked after we issue the manifesto the question is will the attacks have merit if we were all white as the driven snow there would be no problem however under such circumstances we would all be poor for this reason it is important to get independent academics and non academics with no connections to the utilities or generators to sign the manifesto i fall into this later category as i believe do a number of other individuals the addition of solow would obviously help as would arrow or mcfadden dale jorgenson would also be a great addition because he has never worked or testified for these firms the same goes for paul krugman on the other hand pual brings some heavy baggage i understand it is important to have as many names attached to the manifesto as possible however pauls name may hurt phil

the speaker introduced a bill that would order the ca puc to establish a rate component to permit the utilities to recover its net undercollected amount over a period of ten years sounds like there may be a haircut in there somewhere authorize the state water dept to purchase power on behalf of utilities and munis order the ca puc to create a separate rate component to cover the depts cost of purchasing the power authorize the treasurer to issue debt backed by ratepayers to cover any difference between the price the water dept buys the power for and the price that can be collected from ratepayers under the rate freeze authorizes the state director of finance to accept on behalf of the state any tangible asset of an electrical corporation presumably the state is looking to get something from the ious say the hydro assets in exchange for giving the utility its net undercollected amount the bill is long and havent yet had a chance to review it in detail were faxing the bill the bill will be controversial and it is unclear who in the legislature has bought into it though the governor signaled his general support for this sort of approach in a press conference last night announcing the results of the power auction the assembly is scheduled to have a hearing on the bill later today will pass on more info as we get it jeff

jimricklinda i have faxed to you a copy of the resolutions that came out of the western governors meeting last friday we were pleased to see that there was no language endorsing price caps in the documents nor was there even a section suggesting that they be studied the resolutions included many of our suggestions power supply contractsrate reforms to send more accurate price signals demand exchanges eliminating barriers to distributed generation etc there was also a specific endosement of construction and expansion of pipelines and electric transmission the thursday evening keynote by bennett johnston was typical old fox louisiana style rhetoric saying that even though price caps didnt work geejust this one time they should be instituted for just the short term his client is socaled the morning session started off rocky with way too much discussion about price caps or cost plus ratemaking being a good idea mid way thru the program gov kempthorne affirmatively stated that he did not agree with price caps and that actually started the discussion back on the right road the governors met in closed session at noon and then later in the day and ultimately there were enough republican votes to make sure that price caps were not endorsed doe secretary abraham was not particularly vocal during his time on the panel but did give good anti price cap interviews with the press later and good old market man curt hebert had some very strong statements against price caps his colleagues massey and breathitt were both there and did not echo the same sentiments paul and i will be talking in the next few days to plan our next strategy with this groupit will need some continued hand holding and work please feel free to call either of us if you would like more specific info please also forward on to whoever in your group i neglected to copy or would have an interest thanks to all who helped us get ready for this meeting

attached you will find an outline of the federal court litigation filed by sce against the cpuc sces request for a preliminary injunction is scheduled to be heard tomorrow and a decision tomorrow is possible pge has filed a similar action but its claims are not scheduled to be heard tomorrow in summary the utilities are seeking an order permitting them to recover their past and future undercollections they are not directly asking the court to determine that the rate freeze has ended potential outcome is that the court permits sce and later pge to recover these undercollections and orders the cpuc to hold hearings on how to structure the recovery appeal by either side is likely please contact me if you have any questions mds

steve in your absence i left a voicemail for guillermo yesterday pertaining to some information that im not certain gruma was fully aware of when we met monday late last month the cpuc decided to waive interruptible rate program penalties except that they fully expect all interruptible customers to voluntarily respond to the maximum extent feasible in essence our interpretation is that this makes grumas response to an interruption completely voluntary however as we discussed monday the california supply demand imbalances will remain for some time and the utilities will likely resort to rolling black outs if the now voluntary interruptions or other measures dont relieve the situation we recommend that gruma confirm our interpretation directly with edison i have a hard copy of the cpucs decision with a brief cover note from edison if youre interested its probably also available on a cpuc website please call me if questions or we can discuss further on our tuesday conference call george

greetings catherine and roger a puc staffer has called our outside lawyer saying that a high school in ontario ca called to complain that were turning back the school for credit issues the staffer says that a hospital might also be involved can you provide any more information the puc staffer does not seem to have much information but has nonetheless seems inclined to write us a letter asking us to explain sort of ironic puc commissioner woods states that his goal is to drive all esps from the state the legislature passes and the governor signs a bill prohibiting direct access and now the puc is concerned that california might actually be succeeding in its efforts to kill choice the puc is particularly concerned since they recently passed an order prohibiting gas customers from returning to the ldc ironic indeed any information that you folks can provide as soon as possible would be greatly appreciated best jeff

fyi transcript of gov davis remarks in san diego today
since the siting legislation created only a program that is voluntary and not in place of the existing laws and we have a committment from the legislature the cec and the govenors office to take another shot in january as they know that this legislation is flawed too many conflicting interests trying to solve a complex problem in too short a time i feel this is too harshwe have already started the process of creating new legislation that will be as close to a consensus as possible for next sessionthis legislation did not hurt us and some companies feel that they can use the processes we have to keep in mind that with the knowledge that there will be major reorganization legislation next year we dont want to offend the friends that we have in sacramento particularly the republicans who were the ones who insisted on an expedited siting bill

hi jeff of course i agree with this that its not a time for politics whether partisan or otherwise but eventually we have to address issues beyond grieving helping and bringing the lunatics to justice why is this happening i do not agree with what clinton said this morning in australia which was because we are a great nation that makes us a target rory ive left it up to timmi to tell me where im going tonight cameron said she wanted to be at napa ill go anywhere the four of you are gathered i look forward to being with you all again rory original message from dasovich jeff and i think partisan politics is about the very last thing that the families of the victims are thinking about at this time best jeff well see you tonite for the bluegrass filming original message

jeff this is the letter im trying to get sent out 
draft of transcribed message from richard sanders voice mail legal to rick shapiro rick forwarded to jim steffes fyi we have not seen the reliant protective order its only been described to me by their general counsel and in the way it was described it was a document that we would probably agree to because theres still some corks and provisions over disagreements about the confidentiality so im gonna try to get mike kirby to get ahold of it this am in terms of the theme to the legislators the question ive got is why havent we even been offered that same deal it shows clearly that theyre trying to isolate us and that theyre treating us differently from everyone else but im not sure how far that goes

reporting from the wga summer conference in couer dalene it was evident from the minute we got here that the governors continue to b e ticked off at ferc for not supporting their efforts on price caps and t hat they are feeling neglected by the administration although we had been told by staff that the resolution that would be voted on today would be su bstantially watered down and not terribly controversial in fact we had seen a copy of the proposed resolution about a week ago and i would agree w ith that descripition the tide turned in a meeting with the governors the mselves on sat and then again on sunday by yesterday a new section and ot her additional language had been added to the resolution the most troubli ng to us is a section that talks about creating regional mechanisms to deci de regional power issues and thatferc should be required to defer to such decisions there is also language stating that ferc intervention on e minent domain is unwarrented and inappropriateeven though we expressed o ur concerns to several of our staff contacts they insisted that the langua ge was greatly watered down from what it could have been and that the gover nors felt that they needed to assert their states rights they also insi sted that the wording was meant to encourage cooperation and to ensure that whatever work was being completed by western stakeholders was given due co nsideration by ferc i argued that defer was not the word that conveyed th at message correctly i lost the resolution will be voted on today at noo n yesterday ferc commissioner brownell doe undersecretary bob card jim conn aughton from the council of enviromental quality i think thats what it is called and steve griels deputy secretary of interior all participated in the energy panel governor kempthorne announced the signing of an mou wit h doe and the wga to cooperate on some studies and workplans primarily on energy efficiences and conservation in the west this by the way was nego tiated and drafted on sunday late nightit appeared that reuben barrales from the white house was the broker and it was accepted on monday morning b y the govs the bottom line on this mou is that doe will give some modest funding to wga to do a study or two it is painfully clear from the discussions yesterday that this administrati on is going to be mired in process the discussion on the energy panel was full of discussion about task forces and studies and interagency cooperatio nblah blah blah ps as we expected davis and locke were not here

jeff and jim i have done some research into the issue of whether the cpuc would be able to restate the udcs px energy charges and thus px credits back to october if the ferc were to apply its mitigation plan back that far thus far my research indicates that the answer is yes or at least there is a strong argument that the answer is yes and it would not violate the rule against retroactive rate making the reasoning is as follows the commission as affirmed by the courts have ruled that they may subject a utilitys rates to refund to account for adjustments made pursuant to a methodology or formula adopted before the date the utilitys rates became subject to refund thus any ratemaking is considered prospective because the formulas are in place before the utilitys rates are made subject to refund the px energy charge is calculated pursuant to the formulamechanism set forth in the utilitys tariffs these charges were always subject to adjustment on a prospective basis due to the settlement process the change in energy prices which would be effected by the ferc ruling could very well be viewed as an adjustment made pursuant to a formula thus the change would not be considered retroactive ratemaking i had a chance to talk with mike day for a couple of minutes about this issue he concurred with my analysis jeanne ps please forward this e mail to anyone you think needs to see it

attached below is a table summarizing the testimonies of the parties that will be at the settlement table tomorrow can we have a call today to discuss our strategy for tomorrow

roger thanks for the review we want to raise the wholesale distribution concept jeff we will rely on ga to identify our most successful forum eg workshop hearing other generally we are in support of this proposed decision as it establishes a cpuccec commitment to address behind the meter competition and the role of the udc phil we will require technical engineering experts for the workshops and hearings greg

kevin pursuant to your request for a term sheet that would propose legislation to enable broadband access for every home and business in an attempt to bridge the digital divide please see the attached document below the term sheet incorporates several federal solutions to funding a fiber or dsl build out that will support high speed connectivity for residential and business premises including a take back of hdtv spectrum and subsequent auction thereof as well as the establishment of individual tax credits or a broadband buildout and internet access trust fund while the term sheet describes different opportunities for the government to endorse the build out of last mile infrastructure the federal solutions set forth do not have a high probability of enactment by the next congress thus we are identifying additional means of promoting broadband access through state and municipal governments as well as private initiatives we will forward a supplemental document to you in the coming weeks that describes additional avenues perhaps we could meet at that time to discuss the full array of options i look forward to hearing your thoughts or comments regards lara

first let me thank all of you who have been drafted into the enron communications army communications is rapidly becoming a core business and function of enron and as eci expands both domestically and internationally it will require a significant amount of the state government affairs groups support you all had high draft numbers because you have either expressed an interest in working on telecom and e commerce andor are in a strategic position to assist ecis efforts my understanding from rick is that you will be out on point in your respective regions or in alecks case country in identifying issues of interest for eci provide advocacy and problem solving for ecis regional projects ie fiber builds in the south mr robinson manage regulatorylegislative efforts and help increase ecis visibility with your local policymakers that said hopefully your interest will stay high and positive and this wont seem like the real army the one with the drill sergeants and all now that we have an informal team in place and will likely add a few more folks to actively monitor and participate in telecom please feel free to calle mailvisit with myself one another or any eci person to discuss any issue or answer any question i know that many of us feel pretty overwhelmed by these issues and i dont want anyone to be intimidated we have fantastic people here at eci who can quickly bring you up to speed or provide feedback on a variety of concerns eci is doing some revolutionary things and we will become well known very soon you will get to be a part of that please let me know what issues seem hot in your areas what types of things you feel you should know more about and how much focus you believe you will able to give telecom in addition to the workload you already have there is always something going on in this industry and we will need to balance interests carefully sue nord and i will be getting out issue books to the whole state ga group here in the coming weeks this should be a useful tool to help you prioritize your workload i will be sending on to you more clips about eci our products and internal info to give you a better feel for what we are trying to accomplish we may also start some conference calls good god not another one and expect to caucus when we meet at group functions also everyone should own a newtons telecom dictionary e mail me if you dont have one i am very excited to be working alongside all of you and hope we can keep an interactive dialogue of our progress and deeds best scott

fyi edison has been successful at peeling off one of the esps new west seems that in exchange for getting paid negative ctcs new west may have agreed to take the position that all da customers should be charged for edisons undercollection im not aware of any other esps that are willing to take that position the salient quote in new wests supplemental phc statement reads it is the position of new west energy that all customers both bundled service customers and direct access customers are equally responsible for payment of the net undercollections fairness dictates that bundled customers and direct access customers are both assessed their fair share of the responsibility for repaying the amount of the net undercollections as may be determined by the commission obviously not a helpful statement new wests supplemental phc statement is attached best jeff

pennfutures e cubed is a commentary biweekly email publication concerning the current themes and trends in the energy market
with the announcement of enrons acquisition by dynegy behind us and with the initial severance process completed it seemed an appropriate time to e ffect some organizational changes so that we as a group are better prepared to meet the challenges of the future before i turn to the organizational changes i would like to say a few words about those who will be leaving t he company as a result of the initial severance youll know who they are b y their absence on the organizational chart leading and being a part of t his group has been a privilegei am thankful for every day that i have had that responsibility and thankful for however long i continue to have the re sponsibility this sense of privilege and thankfulness is primarily driven by having had the opportunity to get to know and care about such a dedicat ed group of professionals and support staff and who to a person are also very decent and good people to say good bye to some of our colleagues is not easy i want to on behalf of all of us thank them for their hard wor k their integrity their decency and the good times and laughter that we shared i trust that many of us will find ways to sustain friendships that have been and will continue to be very special thanks to each of you who are leaving for all you have done as to the organizational structure it has become increasingly apparent to me that the existing organization with a mix of groups organized along fun ctional and regional lines particularly within the us has impeded our ability to get things done in the most efficient fashion at times the nee d to rationalize the organizational structure in order to consolidate all us energy functions is a strong need from my perspective as a result jim steffes will lead the us energy group along with sue nord who will j ointly report to jim and myself sue will assist jim in the leadership of the group and take on project management responsibilities as warranted to h elp jim shoulder a significant burden also reporting to jim will be a lea dership group for us energy that will be as follows wholesale electrici ty will be led by christi nicolay retail electricity and natural gas will be led by harry kingerski wholesale gas will be led by leslie lawner la st but not least jeff dasovich and sue mara who will continue to focus o n california energy issues will report to jim sue mara will also be part of the wholesale electricity team steve montovano who will continue to report to me will lead a commercial development effort along with dan allegretti with the elimination of the regional groups i also recognize that there is a need to continue to focus on how we as a group address our politicalleg islative needs across the us paul kaufman will lead a small group that w ill address that need and that will focus on state political support paul will also take the lead for government affairs in support of corporate dev elopment efforts across the us much of the rest of the group remains the same linda robertson will conti nue to lead the washington group with sarah novosel who reports to linda taking the lead role in our coordination of activities at ferc amr ibrahi m will continue to lead the support of the global assets group and also con tinue to manage the risk analytics function maggy huson will take over su pport of the non energy business units which are as follows global market s industrial markets networks and broadband rob hemstock will continue to lead the support of enron canada paul dawson who heads up government affairs for europe sergio assad who heads up government affairs for sout h america and mike grimes and mark crowther who head up our asian efforts will continue to jointly report to the business units and myself i am also forming a north american leadership group for government affairs to provide policy guidance for the larger group and the company that comm ittee will consist of rob hemstock maggy huson amr ibrahim paul kaufman harry kingerski leslie lawner steve montovano christi nicolay sue nord sarah novosel linda robertson jim steffes and myself we will also con tinue to have an rcr committee that will consist of maggy huson harry king erski sue nord linda robertson jim steffes myself finally i am form ing a dynegyenron regulatory approvals working group that will consist of jose bestard paul dawson paul kaufman sue nord sarah novosel and myself no organizational structure or set of organizational changes is either perf ect or permanent i believe these changes will make us better and more pre pared for the future however we must be prepared to further adjust as th e future unfolds for the company one final note i am deeply sorry that each of you has had to live through this uncertain and troubled period for the company we are all saddened by the recognition that we are in the midst of changes that will leave our gr oup fundamentally altered but we must resolve to do our best for each othe r and ourselves during this period of change to ensure that what emerges f or those of us who do remain a part of the new dynegy reflects the excelle nce and integrity that has characterized our group personally i will do all i can for as long as i can to steer the group through this to the ver y best place possible your continued dedication and support is very much appreciated hang in there and thanks
i cant take credit for this but am sharing with you all anyway

we must go after this i need some specific direction with exactly what you would like us to have our clients do i see this as breaking our market down into the following as each are effected a bit differently a specific alignment with the contracts we signed in august those clients we are marketing to and cant sign a new contract due to the suspension existing clients whom we are risk with if there are any restrictions on extensions suggest that we set up a call on mon or tues would like myself angela schwarz lamar frazier david cox gayle muench and michael mann in attendance

jeff asked that i send this to you this must be filed by friday were trying to get as many parties as possible to join with us love to have you with us here is the first draft
jeff im told by our core procurement people that enron has refused to enter into any term gas contracts for this winter because of problems they have with us on the electric side personally that makes no sense to me we have the pucs security order that guarantees payment and judge montali has made it clear that he will approve the payment on all gas contracts it seems to me that if this is true enron is really screwing itself which is no the way enron typically does business can you check with your people we are now in the process of finalizing our needs for the winter
sorry about that i should have said cindy came in first for the week not andy as you can see i apologize to both for the mistake

good morning committee members dr barkovich asked that i pass this on please note a significant concern is that pge is not dropping the filed rate doctrine lawsuit if it wins it will be able to recover all of its expenses for customers when it wants while it says it will attempt to recover over a long enough period to avoid rate increases and presumably from all customers the cpuc could change this and recover only from large customers eg to please burton and with rate increases i think svmg should seriously consider not supporting unless the law suits are dropped barbara

assembly member tim leslie is interested in sponsoring a bill which would grant air credits to prospective power plant owners in exchange for using reclaimed water the bill is in its infancy and none of the details have been worked out his office would like to know if enron would be interested in providing technical assistance with the measure they approached enron because of the roseville plant recognizing that roseville already has its air credits and is already scheduled to use reclaimed water thoughts
